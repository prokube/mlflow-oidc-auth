# names its algorithm in an unauthenticated header, so a decoder that trusts that field lets the
# presenter decide how — or whether — their token is verified. RFC 8725 §3.1 is explicit that the
# set must be pinned by the verifier.
#
# The same asymmetric set the provider registry accepts (#308): signatures are checked against
# keys fetched from the provider's JWKS, so a symmetric algorithm has no legitimate use here and
# an unsigned token none at all.
# The ceiling. A provider's own ``allowed_algorithms`` narrows within this set (see
# :func:`_jwt_for`); nothing widens it. There is deliberately no module-level decoder built from
# it any more — one would look like the live verifier while every validation used a per-provider
# decoder instead, so a change made here would appear to take effect and would not.
