"""Concurrent silent refresh exchanges the refresh token exactly once (issue #367).

The defect: a page load fires several API calls at once. When the session's IdP expiry had
passed, every one of them refreshed — each exchanging the *same* refresh token. Under refresh
token rotation with reuse detection (Keycloak, Okta, Auth0, Entra with rotation on), the IdP
answers the second exchange by revoking the whole token family, and the user is logged out
mid-page. The refresh token also rode in the cookie, so even a lucky winner could be undone by a
loser's response overwriting it.

These tests run the real ``AuthMiddleware`` against a real SQLite store, with a fake IdP that
implements rotation *and* reuse detection, so a second exchange is not merely counted — it is
fatal, as it is in production.
