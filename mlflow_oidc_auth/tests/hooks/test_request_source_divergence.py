"""Tests for reading request parameters from the source MLflow reads (issues #285, #286).

Both bugs are the same shape: the plugin resolves a request one way while MLflow
resolves the same request another way, so the authorization decision is made about a
different thing than the one MLflow acts on.

#285 — ``_extract_param_from_all_sources`` preferred the query string, but MLflow's
``_get_request_message`` consults the query string ONLY for a GET with a non-empty
one; every other method is proto-parsed from the body and the query string is ignored
outright. ``POST /experiments/update?experiment_id=<own>`` with ``{"experiment_id":
"<victim>"}`` in the body therefore authorized ``<own>`` while MLflow renamed
``<victim>``.

#286 — ``_find_validator`` keyed its lookup on the literal ``request.method``, but
werkzeug auto-registers HEAD on every GET rule and dispatches it to the same view.
Every validator is registered under "GET", so HEAD matched nothing, and a missing
validator is not a deny — it falls through unvalidated, leaking an existence and
exact-size oracle over any tenant's data.
