"""Every route MLflow serves must be accounted for by the authorization layer (#286, #291).

``before_request_hook`` refuses a non-admin request on a route that has no validator, no
response filter and no entry on the open list (``hooks/route_policy.py``). That makes a
missing validator a denial rather than an unchecked route, but a denial is still a broken
feature for the users who should have access, so these tests sweep the WHOLE surface:

* ``test_every_flask_route_is_accounted_for`` walks every rule in MLflow's Flask
  ``url_map`` and every method it serves (HEAD folded onto GET, exactly as the hook does).
  Each pair must be validator-mapped, filtered in ``after_request``, served under an
  unprotected prefix, or listed below. A new MLflow route that is none of these fails.
* ``test_every_mutating_proto_is_gated`` walks every protobuf message MLflow registers via
  ``get_endpoints()`` and requires every one that looks like a mutation to be gated.

The lists below may only SHRINK: an entry that gains a validator, or that MLflow stops
registering, fails the test until it is removed.
