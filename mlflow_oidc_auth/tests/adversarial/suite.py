"""Reusable pieces for the adversarial suite (issue #307).

Two things live here:

``Issuer``
    A stand-in identity provider: its own RSA key, its own ``iss``, its own audience, and a
    ``mint`` that signs whatever claims it is handed. Two of them is the minimum needed to ask
    any cross-issuer question at all.

``TokenAdversarySuite``
    The cases themselves, as a base class. A new provider type — the Kubernetes service-account
    provider in #314, a second OIDC issuer in #313 — inherits it and supplies the ``verify``
    fixture: a callable that takes a token and raises if it is not acceptable *for that
    provider*. Every case below then applies to it without being rewritten, which is the
    acceptance criterion the issue asks for: a new provider inherits the suite rather than
    re-implementing it.
