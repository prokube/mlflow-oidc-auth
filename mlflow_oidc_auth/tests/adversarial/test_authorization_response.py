"""Mix-up cases against the authorization response — RFC 9207 (issue #307).

The three cases the issue names — missing ``iss``, stripped ``iss``, mismatched ``iss`` — plus
the ones that decide whether the rule can be enforced without breaking working deployments.

The decision lives in ``mlflow_oidc_auth/authorization_response.py`` as a pure function. #316
wires it into the per-provider callback; these cases are what it will have to keep passing.
