"""Identity provider registry (issue #308).

Configuration is a flat set of ``OIDC_*`` singletons and cannot express more than one identity
provider. This module adds a structured registry that can, while leaving the flat variables as
the sole source of truth for deployments that have not adopted it.

**Nothing consumes this yet.** It is the shape the rest of the enterprise-identity epic (#304)
is built against; login, callback and token validation are unchanged by this module.

Two ways to configure it, both read through the existing ``config_providers`` chain so secrets
managers keep working:

``AUTH_PROVIDERS``
    A JSON array of provider objects.
``AUTH_PROVIDERS_FILE``
    A path to a file containing the same JSON.

With neither set, a single provider ``default`` is synthesised from the flat ``OIDC_*``
variables with ``jit`` / ``every_login`` / ``authoritative`` — which is what the plugin does
today, so an existing deployment sees no change.

Invalid entries are **dropped, not repaired**, and the reasons are reported so startup can log
them. Dropping rather than raising follows the ``_warn_if_*`` precedent in ``config.py``:
``AppConfig`` is a module-level singleton imported by tooling with nothing to do with login —
Alembic's migration environment, for one — so raising here would take that tooling down over a
provider it never uses. Dropping is also the deny-by-default answer: an entry that cannot be
validated does not exist, so nobody can authenticate through it.

            ``user_identities`` rows (#333).
        type: One of ``oidc``, ``saml``, ``k8s``.
        display_name: Human-readable label for the login picker.
        provisioning: ``jit`` creates users on first login, ``scim`` expects an external
            directory to create them, ``none`` requires them to exist already.
        group_sync: When group membership is refreshed from provider claims.
        group_sync_mode: ``authoritative`` replaces local membership with the claim,
            ``additive`` only adds.
        admin_source: Where administrator status may come from. Never ``scim``.
        interactive: Whether this provider can carry a browser login flow, and so whether it
            belongs on the login page (#317, #330). Independent of ``type``, which describes how
            a credential is *verified*: a ``k8s`` provider verifies tokens exactly as an
            ``oidc`` one does, but a projected service-account token is presented directly as a
            bearer credential — there is no authorization endpoint to redirect to. Defaults
            from the type and cannot be set True for a type that has no browser flow.
        identity_binding: Which token field identifies the user.
        allowed_email_domains: Required when binding on ``email``; an email-bound provider
            with no domain restriction lets anyone who can prove any address take an account.
        allowed_algorithms: Accepted JWT signing algorithms.
        audience: Expected ``aud``. Required — a token with no audience check is valid for
            any relying party the issuer serves.
        issuer: Expected ``iss``, when known.
        discovery_url: OIDC discovery document, for ``oidc`` providers.
        client_id: OAuth client id, for ``oidc`` providers.
        jwks_inline: Key set written into configuration, for a cluster whose JWKS cannot be
            fetched. The only mode that needs no network at all.
        jwks_uri: Key set URL, when it is known and discovery is not readable.
        ca_bundle_path: CA bundle for fetching from the cluster's API server.
        in_cluster: Fetch keys from the API server using the pod's own service-account token.
        namespace_allowlist: Namespaces whose service accounts may be provisioned. Empty means
            none — a service-account token carries no group claim, so nothing else narrows who

    Three rules, in descending order of how badly they end:

    * ``none`` is rejected outright. It means the token carries no signature, so accepting it
      lets anyone mint a token for that provider. It is worse than the algorithm-confusion case
      below, which at least requires a key to confuse.
    * Symmetric (HMAC) algorithms are rejected outright, not merely when a JWKS source appears
      on the same entry. This plugin has no symmetric-key verification path at all — signatures
      are checked against keys fetched from the provider's JWKS — so an HMAC entry cannot work,
      and the only question is whether it fails safely. Gating on whether the *entry* names a
      key source was evadable by omitting ``issuer``/``discovery_url`` while the deployment's
      flat ``OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL`` still supplied one, which is the confusion setup restored.
      This is stricter than issue #308 asked for, deliberately.
    * Anything not in the supported set is rejected rather than passed through, so a typo
      becomes a startup message instead of an algorithm a consumer silently does not honour.

    Returns:
        ``(algorithms, errors)``. Names are canonically spelled, so a consumer comparing against
        ``"RS256"`` matches an entry written as ``"rs256"``.
