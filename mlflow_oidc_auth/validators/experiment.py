    The value is normalized through MLflow's OWN ``validate_path_is_safe``, which is
    exactly what the artifact handlers run before serving. Calling anything less than
    that whole function drifts from what MLflow acts on, and every step matters:

      1. ``_decode`` unquotes REPEATEDLY, whereas werkzeug percent-decodes a URL only
         once. Parsing the once-decoded value diverged: "%2531%2532/r/artifacts" reaches
         us as "%31%32/r/artifacts" (no match -> DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION, i.e. allow on
         the shipped MANAGE default) while MLflow resolves it to "12/r/artifacts" and
         serves experiment 12's artifacts.
      2. ``_escape_control_characters``.
      3. File URI handling. Depending on the Python platform, MLflow 3.16 may
         canonicalize relative ``file:`` values to absolute paths and reject them, or
         leave them relative. Keeping this call aligned with the handler ensures the
         authorization parser sees the same normalized value when one is returned.

    ``validate_path_is_safe`` RAISES for paths MLflow refuses outright ("..", "#",
    and platform-dependent absolute paths). Those fall through to the raw value below,
    which cannot turn URI syntax into a numeric experiment segment; MLflow rejects the
    request before serving an artifact (issue #283).
