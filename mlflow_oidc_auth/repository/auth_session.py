"""Server-side sessions (issue #310).

The session used to live entirely in the browser cookie: Starlette signed a dict with
``SECRET_KEY`` and the server kept nothing, so a valid cookie stayed valid until it expired and
there was nothing to revoke. Sessions are now rows, and the cookie carries only an opaque
identifier.

The table landed with the Phase 0 migration (#333); this is the data access over it.

**The lookup is one statement.** ``resolve`` joins ``auth_sessions`` to ``users`` and returns
everything the authentication path needs — session validity, username, admin and active flags —
because that path runs on every request and its statement count is a budget (#305), not an
implementation detail. A second round trip for the user would double it.
