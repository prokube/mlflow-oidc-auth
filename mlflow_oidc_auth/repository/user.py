# Hash method for secrets stored in ``users.password_hash`` (issue #336).
#
# Nothing in this plugin stores a human-chosen password. Every value written here comes from
# ``mlflow_oidc_auth.user.generate_token()`` — 24 characters drawn by ``secrets.choice`` from a
# 62-character alphabet, about 143 bits of entropy — and no endpoint accepts an operator-supplied
# password. A memory-hard KDF exists to make brute-forcing *low-entropy* human passwords
# expensive; against 143 bits there is nothing to brute-force, so the ~48 ms that Werkzeug's
# default scrypt costs bought no security while being paid on every basic-authenticated request.
# Verification drops from ~47 ms to ~0.08 ms.
#
# Migration is handled by Werkzeug itself: the method is encoded in the stored hash and
# ``check_password_hash`` dispatches on it, so hashes written before this change keep verifying
# under scrypt, unchanged. Only newly written hashes use this method — a secret moves over when
# its token is rotated. Existing hashes are deliberately never re-hashed in place: a stored
# secret cannot be distinguished from a hypothetical operator-set password, and silently
# re-hashing one at this cost factor would weaken it.
#
# This is intentionally a constant, not configuration. It is a property of what we store, not a
# deployment choice, and the failure mode of setting it wrong is silent.
#
# The entropy premise is not self-enforcing: ``generate_token()`` lives in another module, and
# shortening it or narrowing its alphabet would make this cost factor indefensible without
# anything here changing. ``TestTokenEntropyPremise`` in
# ``tests/repository/test_user_token_hashing.py`` pins the token's length, alphabet and resulting
# entropy, so that change fails a test instead of passing quietly. If one of those tests has to
# be updated, this constant has to be re-justified in the same diff.

        ``None`` means "not supplied" for every parameter but one: the corresponding column is
        left as it is. The defaults for the two flags previously read ``False`` while the guards
        below tested for ``None``, so a caller that omitted them silently cleared ``is_admin``
        and ``is_service_account`` instead of preserving them (issue #338).

        The exception is ``password_expiration``, because expiry is a property of the *secret*
        rather than of the user:

        * When ``password`` is supplied, the secret is being replaced, so it gets a fresh
          lifetime — exactly the one passed in, with ``None`` meaning "does not expire". The
          previous value is never inherited. Inheriting it meant that rotating an already-expired
          token produced a new token that was rejected on its first use, because ``authenticate``
          checks expiry before comparing the hash.
        * When ``password`` is not supplied, the expiry is only changed if one was passed.

        A consequence worth stating: an expiry cannot be cleared without also rotating the
        secret. That is deliberate — extending the life of a credential that has already been
        issued should require issuing a new one.

        Parameters:
            username: Identity key of the user to update.
            password: New secret. Hashed with :data:`TOKEN_HASH_METHOD`.
            password_expiration: Expiry for the stored secret. See the semantics above.
            is_admin: New administrator flag.
            is_service_account: New service-account flag.
            active: Whether the account may authenticate. Setting it False is how a directory
                deprovisions a user (issue #311).
            managed_by: Which source owns this row.
            written_by: Which source is performing this write, for the ownership guard (#319).
                None means an unattributed internal write, treated as ``manual``.
            admin_override: Whether an administrator asked for this explicitly. Break glass:
                always permitted, always audited.

        Returns:
            User: The updated user entity.

        Raises:
