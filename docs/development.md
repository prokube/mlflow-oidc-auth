# Development

This guide covers setting up a local development environment, running tests, and contributing to mlflow-oidc-auth.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Python | 3.12 (via `.python-version`) | Backend server, tests |
| Node.js | 24+ | Frontend build and tests |
| Yarn | Latest | Frontend package manager |
| Git | Latest | Version control |

The project uses Python 3.12 for development and CI. The minimum supported Python version for end users is 3.10.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlflow-oidc/mlflow-oidc-auth
cd mlflow-oidc-auth
```

### Quick Start (Dev Server Script)

The fastest way to start a local development environment:

```bash
./scripts/run-dev-server.sh
```

This script:
1. Creates a Python virtual environment in `venv/` (if not present)
2. Installs the package in editable mode with all extras
3. Starts the MLflow server with the OIDC auth plugin on `localhost:8080`
4. Waits for the server to be ready
5. Installs frontend dependencies via Yarn (if not present)
6. Starts the Vite watcher for frontend hot-reload

> **Note:** You need a `.env` file with valid OIDC configuration before starting. See [Configuration](configuration.md) for required variables.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up each component individually:

#### Backend

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install in editable mode with dev and test dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"

# Create a .env file with your OIDC provider settings
# (see Configuration docs for all variables)

# Start the server with hot-reload
mlflow --env-file .env server \
  --uvicorn-opts "--reload --log-level debug" \
  --app-name oidc-auth \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8080 \
  --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
```

#### Frontend

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd web-react
yarn install

# Development mode (watches for changes, rebuilds into mlflow_oidc_auth/ui/)
yarn watch

# Or start the Vite dev server with HMR (serves on a separate port)
yarn dev
```

The frontend builds into `mlflow_oidc_auth/ui/`, which is served by the FastAPI backend at `/oidc/ui/`.

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests (pytest)

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest mlflow_oidc_auth/tests

# Run with coverage
coverage run -m pytest -m "not integration" mlflow_oidc_auth/tests
coverage xml

# Run a specific test file
pytest mlflow_oidc_auth/tests/routers/test_auth.py

# Run a specific test class or method
pytest mlflow_oidc_auth/tests/test_sqlalchemy_store.py::TestUserOperations::test_create_user

# Run tests via tox (mirrors CI)
pip install tox
tox -e py
```

Test configuration is in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`:
- `asyncio_mode = "auto"` — async tests run automatically
- Tests in `mlflow_oidc_auth/tests/integration/` are excluded by default (require a running server)
- Tests marked `e2e` need Keycloak; the default tox env deselects them (see [End-to-end identity tests](#end-to-end-identity-tests))
- Directories like `mlruns`, `htmlcov`, `__pycache__` are excluded from test discovery

#### How CI runs the suite: shards

The "Unit tests" workflow runs the Python suite as four parallel jobs. Each shard collects the
whole suite and runs only the test files assigned to it (`mlflow_oidc_auth/tests/_sharding.py`);
a file is never split across shards. To reproduce one shard locally:

```bash
tox -e py -- --shard-count=4 --shard-index=2
# or: pytest -m "not integration and not e2e" --shard-count=4 --shard-index=2 mlflow_oidc_auth/tests
```

Use the `--opt=value` form: pytest registers these options from the test suite's `conftest.py`.
Plain `tox -e py` (and plain `pytest`) still runs everything in one process.

The final "Run Unit testing" job — the check name to gate on — passes only if the frontend job
and every shard passed, and runs `scripts/ci/check_shards.py` to confirm the shards collected the
same suite and together ran every collected test exactly once.

Files are balanced by the per-file durations in `mlflow_oidc_auth/tests/shard_weights.json`. A
new test file with no entry is still assigned (weighted by its test count); the weights affect
balance, never what runs. When one shard is noticeably slower than the rest, download the
`unit-test-shard-*` artifacts of a recent run and rebuild the weights:

```bash
# several runs' reports may be passed together to average out runner variance
python scripts/ci/shard_weights.py path/to/unit-test-shard-*/junit.xml
```

### Frontend Tests (Vitest)

```bash
cd web-react

# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run with coverage
yarn test:coverage

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run src/features/experiments/experiments-page.test.tsx
```

Test configuration is in `vite.config.ts`:
- Environment: `jsdom`
- Coverage provider: `v8` with `lcov` reporter
- Coverage thresholds: 80% for statements, branches, functions, and lines
- Setup file: `src/tests/setup.tsx`

### Integration Tests (Playwright)

Integration tests require a running mlflow-oidc-auth instance:

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
python -m playwright install chromium

# Run against a local instance
tox -e integration

# Run against an already-running instance
export MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
tox -e integration-live
```

### End-to-end identity tests

`mlflow_oidc_auth/tests/e2e/` drives real OIDC, SAML and SCIM flows against a real **Keycloak
26.7.4**. Nothing is mocked: the plugin is started as a real server (`mlflow server --app-name
oidc-auth`) in a subprocess on a free loopback port, and the suite plays the browser with plain
`httpx2` — it follows redirects, fills in Keycloak's login form and submits the SAML POST-binding
form itself, with no browser engine. CI runs it on every pull request as the required job
**E2E identity (Keycloak)** (`.github/workflows/e2e-identity.yml`), with the auth database on
PostgreSQL.

The realm is code: `scripts/e2e/keycloak/realm-mlflow-e2e.json` (realm `mlflow-e2e`, users
`alice@example.com` / `bob@example.com` / `carol@example.com` / `dave@example.com` in `mlflow-users` and
`root@example.com` in `mlflow-admins`, a confidential OIDC client `mlflow`, a public OIDC client
`mlflow-public` with PKCE S256 required, and a SAML client `mlflow-saml`). It contains no keys —
Keycloak generates the realm keys on import — and its passwords and client secret are test
literals. At start-up the suite rewrites every client's redirect, ACS and SLO URLs for the port
the app actually got.

Keycloak's http listener is published on a **second port, 8081**, as well. Keycloak in dev mode
derives the issuer from the request's host and port, and the public-client provider
(`keycloak-public`, `"public_client": true`, no secret) needs an issuer of its own: the registry
refuses two providers claiming one. Without the second port only the public-client test skips (or
fails under `MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_REQUIRE=1`). The Keycloak zip serves one http port, so that test does
not run against it.

Keycloak must serve **https** as well as http: the plugin refuses a SAML IdP whose SSO/SLO URLs
are not https. Give it a throwaway certificate:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/kc-tls
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 1 -subj /CN=localhost \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1" \
  -keyout /tmp/kc-tls/tls.key -out /tmp/kc-tls/tls.crt
chmod 0644 /tmp/kc-tls/tls.key   # the container runs as a non-root user
```

Start Keycloak with Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name keycloak -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:8081:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:8443:8443 \
  -v "$PWD/scripts/e2e/keycloak:/opt/keycloak/data/import:ro" \
  -v /tmp/kc-tls:/opt/keycloak/conf/tls:ro \
  -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
  quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.7.4 start-dev --import-realm --https-port 8443 \
  --https-certificate-file /opt/keycloak/conf/tls/tls.crt \
  --https-certificate-key-file /opt/keycloak/conf/tls/tls.key
```

or from the Keycloak zip (needs Java 21+):

```bash
cp scripts/e2e/keycloak/realm-mlflow-e2e.json keycloak-26.7.4/data/import/
KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
  keycloak-26.7.4/bin/kc.sh start-dev --import-realm --http-port 8080 --https-port 8443 \
  --https-certificate-file /tmp/kc-tls/tls.crt --https-certificate-key-file /tmp/kc-tls/tls.key
```

The zip keeps its dev database in `data/h2` and skips a realm that already exists, so delete
`data/h2` after editing the realm JSON. Then, once `http://localhost:8080/realms/mlflow-e2e`
answers:

```bash
tox -e e2e
# or, in an environment with '.[full,test]' and 'scim2-tester[httpx2]==0.4.0' installed:
pytest -m e2e mlflow_oidc_auth/tests/e2e -rs
```

The default `tox` environment deselects the `e2e` marker. Without Keycloak the suite skips, unless
`MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_REQUIRE=1` (set in CI), which makes an unreachable Keycloak a failure.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_KEYCLOAK_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Keycloak over http: OIDC and the admin REST API |
| `MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_KEYCLOAK_HTTPS_URL` | `https://localhost:8443` | Keycloak over https: SAML |
| `MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_KEYCLOAK_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL` | `http://localhost:8081` | Keycloak's http listener on its second published port: the public-client provider's issuer |
| `MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_KEYCLOAK_CA` | unset | The certificate above; verifies the https leg. Unset, verification is off — allowed only when the https URL is loopback |
| `MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_KEYCLOAK_ADMIN` / `_PASSWORD` | `admin` / `admin` | Keycloak bootstrap admin, for the admin REST API |
| `MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_REQUIRE` | unset | `1`: fail instead of skip when Keycloak is unreachable |
| `MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_DB_URI` | unset (temp SQLite) | PostgreSQL URI with CREATEDB; a fresh database is created in it per run and dropped afterwards |
| `MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_WORKERS` | 1 on SQLite, 4 on PostgreSQL | uvicorn workers for the app. SQLite's refresh guard is process-wide only, by design |
| `MLFLOW_OIDC_E2E_LOG_DIR` | a pytest temp dir | Where `app-server.log` goes (CI uploads it on failure). A failing test prints its tail |

The app is configured through its real environment variables — `AUTH_PROVIDERS` with a
`default` OIDC entry (`identity_binding: email`, JIT, group sync, `admin_source: claims`), a named
OIDC entry `keycloak-named` over the same realm and client — reached through the other loopback
name (`127.0.0.1` for `localhost` and vice versa), because Keycloak derives the issuer from the
request host and the registry refuses two providers with one issuer — and a
`keycloak-saml` entry built from Keycloak's SAML descriptor, `OIDC_USE_REFRESH_TOKEN=true`,
`OIDC_SESSION_EXPIRY_LEEWAY_SECONDS=0` against 10-second Keycloak access tokens — from a clean
environment with `PYTHON_DOTENV_DISABLED=1`, so neither your shell nor a repository `.env` leaks
into it.

**What is covered.**

- *OIDC*: login and JIT provisioning (`managed_by=manual`, synced groups, admin from the
  `mlflow-admins` claim); the cookie carries only an opaque session id; forged, legacy
  (pre-server-side) and re-signed cookies are refused; the **#367 refresh race** — eight
  concurrent requests on an expired session all succeed and Keycloak, which rotates refresh
  tokens with reuse detection on, records exactly one `REFRESH_TOKEN` event and no
  `REFRESH_TOKEN_ERROR`; a control test proves Keycloak really revokes a replayed refresh
  token; RP-initiated logout revokes the session before the browser leaves for Keycloak, and
  revokes the stored refresh token at Keycloak's RFC 7009 `revocation_endpoint`, so the
  `offline_access` grant does not outlive logout (the token is `invalid_grant` afterwards); a
  session opened through the **named** OIDC provider is logged out at that provider's
  end-session endpoint with its own `id_token_hint`, and `/auth/status` reports that provider.
- *The browser never loads the React SPA*: `Browser.follow` stops at a redirect into `/oidc/ui/`
  and tests assert on its `Location`, so the suite does not need `web-react` built.
- *SAML*: SP-initiated login with the session cookie set on the ACS response to a cross-site
  POST that carries only the `SameSite=None` browser-binding cookie (the harness sets
  `SAML_LOGIN_BINDING=on`, since the app runs over loopback http); a genuine Response delivered
  from another browser without that cookie refused (login CSRF); replayed Responses refused; SP-initiated SLO revokes before redirecting and
  completes the LogoutRequest/LogoutResponse round trip; **IdP-initiated SLO**, driven headlessly
  by submitting Keycloak's own logout page, which delivers a signed HTTP-Redirect LogoutRequest to
  `/slo/<id>` through the browser — only the session with that `SessionIndex` ends, the request
  cannot be replayed, and an unsigned copy is refused.
- *SCIM*: `scim2-tester` as a smoke test, then Entra-shaped `PATCH` (`"op": "Replace"`,
  `"value": "False"`) and Okta-shaped `PUT` deprovisioning: the live session, the access token and
  a fresh Keycloak login (`auth.denied_inactive`) are all refused; reactivation restores login
  with the experiment grant intact and the old token still dead.

**What is not, and why.**

- *SP-signed SAML requests* (`sign_requests`): the realm has "client signature required" off and
  the SP signs nothing; signing is covered by the unit tests.
- *Keycloak's admin "log out user"*: its SAML logout is back-channel and would POST to `/slo`,
  which answers `405` by design (only the HTTP-Redirect binding verifies logout signatures).
  IdP-initiated logout is exercised through the browser instead.
- *Bearer-token API access with Keycloak tokens, Kubernetes service accounts, workspaces*
  (`MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES=false`), and SCIM features the endpoint does not implement — Groups,
  attribute projection, `/.search`, PATCH `remove`, stored `name.*` — which the conformance test
  sets aside by tag.
- *One user through two protocols*: an account bound to one provider refuses sign-in through
  another, so each protocol has its own test user.

## Code Style and Formatting

### Python

- **Formatter:** [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) with line length 160
  ```bash
  black mlflow_oidc_auth/
  ```
- **Unused imports:** [autoflake](https://github.com/PyCQA/autoflake) (available as dev dependency)
  ```bash
  autoflake --in-place --remove-all-unused-imports mlflow_oidc_auth/
  ```
- **Security analysis:** [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) (run in CI on `mlflow_oidc_auth/**` paths)

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

- **Formatter:** [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) — semi, tabWidth 2, printWidth 80, trailing commas
  ```bash
  cd web-react
  yarn format
  ```
- **Linter:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with TypeScript, React hooks, React DOM, and Prettier integration
  ```bash
  cd web-react
  yarn lint
  ```
- **Type checking:** TypeScript in strict mode
  ```bash
  cd web-react
  npx tsc -b
  ```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for automated checks before each commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Configured hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`):
- `check-yaml` — validates YAML files
- `check-added-large-files` — blocks files >800KB
- `detect-private-key` — prevents accidental key commits
- `end-of-file-fixer` — ensures files end with newline
- `trailing-whitespace` — removes trailing whitespace
- `mixed-line-ending` — normalizes line endings
- `check-toml` — validates TOML files
- `black` — Python code formatting

## Database Migrations

Schema changes are managed with [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/). Migrations run automatically on application startup in `create_app()`.

### Creating a New Migration

```bash
# Auto-generate a migration from model changes
cd mlflow_oidc_auth/db
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of change"
```

Migration scripts live in `mlflow_oidc_auth/db/migrations/versions/`.

### SQLAlchemy Models

ORM models are in `mlflow_oidc_auth/db/models/` and follow these conventions:
- Prefixed with `Sql`: `SqlUser`, `SqlExperimentPermission`, `SqlGroup`
- Inherit from `Base` (declarative base in `_base.py`)
- Use `Mapped[T]` type annotations for columns

## Git Conventions

### Commit Messages

The project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), enforced by CI:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>
```

- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `ci`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`
- Subject must **not** start with an uppercase letter
- Scope is optional: `feat(auth): add token refresh`

Examples:
```
feat: add workspace permission management
fix(ui): update module-level workspace state synchronously
docs: update installation guide for v1.1
refactor(hooks): simplify permission resolution
test: add coverage for regex permission matching
```

### Pull Requests

PR titles must follow the same Conventional Commits format (validated by `pr-validate-title.yml`).

### Branches

- `main` — production releases
- `rc` — release candidate (pre-release channel)

### Releases

Automated via [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) on push to `main`:
1. Analyzes commit messages to determine version bump
2. Runs `scripts/release.sh` for version bumping
3. Builds the React frontend (`vite build` → `mlflow_oidc_auth/ui/`)
4. Publishes to PyPI
