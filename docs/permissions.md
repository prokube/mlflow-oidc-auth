# Permission System

The plugin enforces role-based access control (RBAC) on all MLflow resources. Every API request is checked against the permission system before reaching MLflow.

## Permission Levels

Five permission levels form a hierarchy:

| Level | Priority | can_read | can_use | can_update | can_delete | can_manage |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| `READ` | 1 | Yes | - | - | - | - |
| `USE` | 2 | Yes | Yes | - | - | - |
| `EDIT` | 3 | Yes | Yes | Yes | - | - |
| `MANAGE` | 4 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `NO_PERMISSIONS` | 100 | - | - | - | - | - |

- **Higher priority wins** when multiple permissions exist (e.g., group A grants READ, group B grants MANAGE — the user gets MANAGE)
- **`NO_PERMISSIONS`** is an explicit denial, not the absence of a permission record. It actively blocks access regardless of other sources
- **Admin users** bypass all permission checks entirely

## Protected Resources

The permission system covers these MLflow resource types:

| Resource | Permission Scope | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Experiments | Per experiment ID | Includes runs within the experiment |
| Registered Models | Per model name | Includes model versions |
| Prompts | Per prompt name | Uses the model permission infrastructure |
| Scorers | Per experiment + scorer name | Compound key |
| Prompt Optimization Jobs | Per job → experiment ID | Job-level operations resolve to the parent experiment's permissions. Creating a job needs EDIT on the experiment and on the prompt in `source_prompt_uri` (`prompts:/<name>/<version>` or `prompts:/<name>@<alias>`; the job registers a new version of it), and READ on every experiment linked to `config.dataset_id` when one is given |
| Evaluation datasets, issues, label schemas, review queues, UI jobs | Per linked experiment | See [Experiment-scoped GenAI routes](#experiment-scoped-genai-routes) |
| Job API jobs (`ajax-api/3.0/jobs/…`) | Per job creator | See [Job API](#job-api) |
| Gateway Endpoints | Per endpoint name | AI Gateway routes |
| Gateway Secrets | Per secret name | AI Gateway secrets |
| Gateway Model Definitions | Per model definition name | AI Gateway model configs |
| Workspaces | Per workspace name | Only when `MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES=true`. See [Workspaces](workspaces) |

## Permission Sources

Permissions can come from four sources. Each source is checked in the order configured by `PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER`.

### Source Types

| Source | Key | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| User permission | `user` | Direct permission assigned to a specific user for a specific resource |
| Group permission | `group` | Permission assigned to a group — inherited by all members. When a user belongs to multiple groups, the highest permission wins |
| Regex permission | `regex` | User-specific regex pattern that matches resource names. Patterns are evaluated by priority (lower number = checked first) |
| Group regex permission | `group-regex` | Group-level regex pattern — inherited by all members. Evaluated by priority like user regex |

### Resolution Order

```
PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER=user,group,regex,group-regex
```

The system checks each source in order and uses the **first permission found**:

1. Check `user` — is there a direct permission for this user + resource?
2. Check `group` — does any of the user's groups have a permission for this resource?
3. Check `regex` — does any of the user's regex patterns match this resource name?
4. Check `group-regex` — does any group regex pattern match?
5. **Fallback**:
   - If workspaces enabled → use workspace permission (see [Workspace Fallback](workspaces#workspace-permissions-as-resource-fallback))
   - If workspaces disabled → use `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION`

Within a single source type (e.g., `group`), if multiple entries match, the **highest permission level wins** (MANAGE > EDIT > USE > READ).

### Which request source is authorized

A resource id can reach MLflow in the URL path, the query string, or the request body.
The plugin reads the id from the same place MLflow will: on a protobuf API route that is
the path parameter if there is one, otherwise the query string for a `GET` that has one
and the JSON body for every other request (the query string is ignored on `POST`,
`PATCH` and `DELETE`). `/ajax-api/2.0/mlflow/upload-artifact` uses the query string only,
and `gateway-proxy` uses the query string on `GET` and the body otherwise.

Every other value the request carries for that field — in any source, under either the
`snake_case` or the `camelCase` spelling — is authorized as well. If a request names two
different resources for one field, the caller needs the permission on both, or the
request is denied with `403`. A request that is missing the id where MLflow reads it is
refused (`400` or `403`); the id is never taken from a source MLflow ignores instead.
Ordinary clients send each id once, or the same id in two places, so they are not
affected.

## Regex Permissions

Regex permissions use Python regular expression syntax to match resource names by pattern rather than by individual resource ID.

### How They Work

1. Patterns are ordered by **priority** (lower number = checked first)
2. The **first matching pattern** determines the permission
3. Both user-level and group-level regex permissions are supported

### Pattern Examples

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `.*` | Any resource name |
| `^prod-.*` | Names starting with "prod-" |
| `.*-test$` | Names ending with "-test" |
| `^(dev\|staging)-.*` | Names starting with "dev-" or "staging-" |
| `^team-alpha/.*` | Names under the "team-alpha/" namespace |

### Regex Resolution Example

```
User regex permissions for experiments:
  Priority 1: "^prod-.*"      → NO_PERMISSIONS
  Priority 2: "^dev-.*"       → MANAGE
  Priority 3: ".*"            → READ

For experiment "dev-ml-model":
  1. Check "^prod-.*"   → no match
  2. Check "^dev-.*"    → match → MANAGE
  Result: MANAGE permission
```

### Regex Safety (ReDoS Protection)

Regex patterns are validated on creation/update to prevent Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks:

- **Maximum pattern length**: 1024 characters. Patterns exceeding this limit are rejected
- **Nested quantifier detection**: Patterns containing nested quantifiers (e.g., `(a+)+`, `(a*)*b`, `(a{2,}){3,}`) are rejected because they can cause catastrophic backtracking
- **Validation errors**: When a pattern is rejected, the server returns an HTTP 400 response with a descriptive error message (e.g., "Pattern exceeds maximum length of 1024 characters" or "Potentially unsafe regex pattern detected: nested quantifiers")

These limits are hardcoded and cannot be configured via environment variables.

## Auto-Grant on Resource Creation

When a user creates a resource, the plugin automatically grants them `MANAGE` permission on it. This applies to:

- `CreateExperiment` → MANAGE on the new experiment
- `CreateRegisteredModel` → MANAGE on the new model
- `RegisterScorer` → MANAGE on the new scorer
- `CreateGatewayEndpoint` → MANAGE on the new endpoint
- `CreateGatewaySecret` → MANAGE on the new secret
- `CreateGatewayModelDefinition` → MANAGE on the new model definition
- `CreateWorkspace` → MANAGE workspace permission (when workspaces enabled)

## Search Result Filtering

For non-admin users, search and list results are filtered to only include resources the user can read:

- `SearchExperiments` — removes experiments the user cannot read
- `SearchRegisteredModels` — removes models the user cannot read
- `SearchModelVersions` — removes model versions whose parent model is unreadable
- `SearchLoggedModels` — removes logged models whose parent experiment is unreadable
- `ListGatewayEndpoints` — removes unreadable gateway endpoints
- `ListGatewaySecretInfos` — removes unreadable gateway secrets
- `ListGatewayModelDefinitions` — removes unreadable model definitions
- `ListWorkspaces` — removes workspaces the user has no READ permission for
- `SearchEvaluationDatasets` — removes datasets linked to any experiment the user cannot read
- Artifact-root listing (`GET /mlflow-artifacts/artifacts` with no `path`) — keeps only experiments the user can read; see [Artifact Access](#artifact-access)

The filtering preserves MLflow's pagination contract — the system continues fetching additional pages until the requested `max_results` is satisfied or no more results exist.

## Artifact Access

Artifacts inherit their experiment's permissions. On the artifact proxy
(`/{api,ajax-api}/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/{artifacts,mpu,presigned}/…`) the experiment is the
first segment of the artifact path (`<experiment_id>/<run_id>/artifacts/…`, or
`workspaces/<ws>/<experiment_id>/…`), normalised exactly as MLflow normalises it before
serving: repeated percent-decoding, a `file:` scheme, `./` and repeated slashes are all
resolved first. Reads need READ, uploads and multipart uploads need EDIT, deletes need
MANAGE.

**A path that names no experiment is denied** with `403` for every method, whatever
`DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION` is. That covers the artifact root (`.`, `%2e`, `./.`, `.//`, an
empty path), a workspace root (`workspaces/<ws>`) and any path whose first segment is not an
experiment id (`models/…`, `workspaces`, …). An experiment id is ASCII decimal digits in
canonical form, so `012` is not experiment `12`. It must name an experiment that exists in the
tracking store, and a failed store lookup denies. A soft-deleted experiment
still exists, so its owner keeps access. A directory with no experiment behind it (for
example what is left after an experiment is garbage-collected) is denied. Only an
administrator can download, upload to or delete the root or such leftovers, since the root
holds every tenant's artifacts.

This assumes MLflow's default layout, where experiment locations sit directly under the
proxy root. If the artifact root or a workspace's `default_artifact_root` adds a prefix
(`mlflow-artifacts:/mlartifacts/<experiment_id>`), the first segment is not an experiment id,
so non-admin requests to those paths are denied.

**Listing the root is filtered, not denied.** `GET /mlflow-artifacts/artifacts` with no
`path`, an empty `path`, or a root-shaped `path` (including `workspaces/<ws>`) is allowed.
MLflow lists only the first `path` value, and so does this check. Every other `path` value
must name an experiment the caller can read, and a root-shaped value that is not first is
denied. The response keeps only entries that name an existing, active experiment the caller
can read. Soft-deleted experiments and directories with no experiment behind them are left
out. With
workspaces enabled, the experiment must also belong to the listed workspace (the one the
path names, otherwise the request's workspace), and the caller needs READ on that workspace.
A `HEAD` on the list route is filtered the same way. Listing a path inside an experiment
still needs READ on that experiment and is not filtered.

Artifact routes outside the proxy:

| Route | Requires |
|-------|----------|
| `GET /get-artifact`, `/{api,ajax-api}/2.0/mlflow/artifacts/list` | READ on the run's experiment |
| `POST /ajax-api/2.0/mlflow/upload-artifact` | EDIT on the run's experiment (`run_uuid` from the query string) |
| `GET /ajax-api/2.0/mlflow/logged-models/<model_id>/artifacts/files` | READ on the logged model's experiment |
| `GET /{api,ajax-api}/2.0/mlflow/logged-models/<model_id>/artifacts/directories` | READ on the logged model's experiment |
| `POST /{api,ajax-api}/2.0/mlflow/artifacts/presigned-upload-url` | EDIT on the experiment of the run (`run_id`) or logged model (`model_id`); a request naming neither is refused |
| `POST /{api,ajax-api}/2.0/mlflow/artifacts/presigned-download-url` | READ on the run's experiment |

Every run or model id the request carries is authorized, in any source (see
[Which request source is authorized](#which-request-source-is-authorized)).

## Resources a request references

Some requests act on one resource but draw on another. The caller then needs a grant on both,
as in MLflow's own auth plugin. Admins are not checked. A referenced resource that does not
exist, or an id that is present but empty, is refused with `403`.

| Request | Target check | Also required |
|---|---|---|
| `model-versions/create` | EDIT on the registered model (`name`) | See [Creating a model version](#creating-a-model-version) |
| `runs/log-metric` | EDIT on the run's experiment | EDIT on the experiment of the logged model in `model_id` |
| `runs/log-batch` | EDIT on the run's experiment | EDIT on the experiment of every logged model in `metrics[].model_id` |
| `artifacts/presigned-upload-url` | — | EDIT on the experiment of the run (`run_id`) or logged model (`model_id`) |
| `gateway/model-definitions/create` | — (open to authenticated users) | USE on the secret in `secret_id` |
| `gateway/model-definitions/update` | EDIT on the model definition | USE on the secret in `secret_id`, if given |
| `gateway/endpoints/create` | — (open to authenticated users) | USE on every model definition in `model_configs[].model_definition_id`; EDIT on the experiment in `experiment_id` (where usage traces are logged), if given |
| `gateway/endpoints/update` | EDIT on the endpoint | USE on every model definition in `model_configs[].model_definition_id`; EDIT on the experiment in `experiment_id`, if given |
| `gateway/endpoints/models/attach` | EDIT on the endpoint | USE on the model definition in `model_config.model_definition_id` |

Every value is read under both spellings (`model_id` / `modelId`) and from every request
source, as described in [Which request source is authorized](#which-request-source-is-authorized).

### Creating a model version

Reading a model version's artifacts (`model-versions/get-artifact`, the download URI) needs
only READ on its registered model. So creating a version needs a grant on everything the
version points at, not only EDIT on the registered model it is created in. For each `source`
value:

| `source` | Also required |
|---|---|
| `models:/<name>/<version>`, `@<alias>`, `/<stage>`, `/latest` (a copy, as `copy_model_version` makes) | READ on registered model `<name>`. `run_id` is not checked. A `model_id` equal to the source version's own `model_id` needs READ on that logged model's experiment; any other `model_id` needs EDIT on its logged model's experiment, because MLflow tags that logged model with the new version. |
| `models:/<model_id>` | READ on the logged model's experiment |
| `runs:/<run_id>/…` | READ on the run's experiment |
| `mlflow-artifacts:/…`, or `http(s)://…/api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/artifacts/…` | READ on the experiment the artifact path names (`<experiment_id>/…` or `workspaces/<ws>/<experiment_id>/…`). A path naming no existing experiment is refused. |
| `dummy-source` or `prompt-template` on a prompt version (MLflow's placeholder sources) | nothing more |
| anything else (`s3://`, `gs://`, `abfss://`, a local path, another URL) | the location must be the artifact root, or lie beneath it, of a run (`run_id`) or logged model (`model_id`) the request names. With neither id, the request is admin-only. |

Outside the copy case, READ on the experiment of every `run_id` and `model_id` is required as
well. A source with a `..` segment (after decoding) or one that cannot be parsed is refused.
MLflow's own clients satisfy these rules: `mlflow.register_model("runs:/…")`,
`log_model(registered_model_name=…)`, `register_model("models:/<model_id>")` and
`copy_model_version` all send a source under the run or logged model they also name, or a
`runs:/`, `models:/` URI.

## HEAD Requests and Route Coverage

A `HEAD` request is authorized exactly like the `GET` it mirrors. werkzeug serves `HEAD` through the `GET` view and keeps the `Content-Length` header, so it gets the same validator and the same search filtering as its `GET` twin. A caller who cannot read a resource cannot use `HEAD` to learn whether it exists or how large it is. Coverage of MLflow's API is checked by a test, `mlflow_oidc_auth/tests/hooks/test_validator_coverage_sweep.py`. It walks every route and method in MLflow's Flask routing table, with `HEAD` folded onto `GET`, and every protobuf message MLflow registers. The test fails on any route, or any mutating message (`Log*`, `Set*`, `Delete*`, `Create*`, …), that does not fall into one of these groups: mapped to a validator, filtered after the request, admin-only, on the documented list of open routes, or on a list of routes still awaiting a validator. That last list can only shrink, and follow-up changes are emptying it. A route MLflow adds later therefore fails the test until it is classified. MLflow's own registry webhook API is admin-only. Its deliveries are not scoped to a tenant, so it is gated the same way as the plugin's own webhook API.

### Routes without a validator

A route that MLflow serves but that has no validator is refused to non-admin users with
`403`. It is not served unchecked. The exceptions are a short list of routes that carry no
tenant data and are open to any authenticated user: the web UI shell and its static assets,
`/version`, `server-info`, `ui-telemetry`, `/graphql` (authorized per field) and the routes
MLflow answers with `501`. Search and list routes whose results are filtered for the caller
are also exempt. The list is `LEGITIMATELY_OPEN` in `mlflow_oidc_auth/hooks/route_policy.py`,
and the coverage sweep reads the same list. Admins are not affected. Adding a validator for a
new MLflow route restores access for non-admins who hold the grant it requires.

## Experiment-scoped GenAI routes

These MLflow routes have no permission record of their own. They take their permission from
the experiment the resource belongs to, under both the `/api` and the `/ajax-api` prefix. As
everywhere else, a request that names more than one resource needs the permission on every
one, and a resource that cannot be resolved is refused, never granted by
`DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION`.

The plugin also sets `g.mlflow_authenticated_user` to the caller before MLflow handles a
request, so MLflow records the caller, not a client-supplied name, as a review queue's owner
and as the reviewer of an item.

| Route family | Operation | Permission required |
|---|---|---|
| Evaluation datasets (`3.0/mlflow/datasets/…`) | get, records `GET`, `experiment-ids` | READ on every linked experiment |
| | tags `PATCH` / `DELETE`, records `POST` / `DELETE` | EDIT on every linked experiment |
| | `DELETE datasets/<id>` | MANAGE on every linked experiment |
| | `create` | EDIT on every experiment in `experiment_ids` (at least one) |
| | `search` | READ on every experiment in `experiment_ids` (at least one); results filtered as above |
| | `add-experiments`, `remove-experiments` | EDIT on every linked experiment and on every experiment named |
| | a dataset linked to no experiment | admin only |
| Issues (`3.0/mlflow/issues…`) | `GET issues/<id>`, `issues/search` | READ on the experiment (search must name one) |
| | `POST issues`, `PATCH issues/<id>` | EDIT on the experiment, plus READ on `source_run_id` if given; `created_by`, if given, must be the caller |
| `issues/invoke`, `genai/evaluate/invoke` | start an issue-detection or evaluation job | EDIT on the experiment, READ on the experiment of every trace in `trace_ids`; for `issues/invoke`, USE on a named gateway secret (`secret_id`) or endpoint (`endpoint_name`) |
| Label schemas (`3.0/mlflow/label-schemas/…`) | `get`, `get-by-name`, `list` | READ on the experiment |
| | `create`, `update`, `delete` | MANAGE on the experiment |
| | a schema with no experiment | readable by any authenticated user; writable by admins only |
| Review queues (`3.0/mlflow/review-queues/…`) | `create` | EDIT on the experiment; the caller becomes the queue's owner. A custom queue's name may not be a registered username (see below); a user queue's name must be an existing, active, non-service account |
| | `get`, `get-by-name`, `items/list` | READ on the experiment, and one of: MANAGE on the experiment, being an assigned user of the queue, or EDIT and owning the queue |
| | `list` | READ on the experiment; a caller without EDIT sees only the queues they are assigned to |
| | `update` | MANAGE on the experiment, or EDIT and owning the queue. A custom queue may not be renamed to a registered username |
| | `update` with `new_owner` | MANAGE on the experiment |
| | `delete`, `items/remove` | MANAGE on the experiment, or EDIT and owning the queue if it is a custom queue (a user queue needs MANAGE) |
| | `items/add` | EDIT on the experiment |
| | `get-or-create-user` | EDIT on the experiment; `user` must be an existing, active, non-service account (it may be a teammate) |
| | `items/set-status` | EDIT on the experiment and being an assigned user of the queue (MANAGE alone is not enough); `completed_by` must be the caller, and is required for `COMPLETE` / `DECLINED` |
| UI jobs (`ajax-api/3.0/mlflow/jobs/<id>`, `jobs/cancel/<id>`) | read / cancel | READ / EDIT on the experiment recorded in the job, or else on the experiment of the run it records; admin only if neither resolves |
| Scorer online scoring (`3.0/mlflow/scorers/online-config(s)`) | `PUT online-config` | EDIT on the experiment and on the scorer (`name`) |
| | `GET online-configs` | READ on the experiment and on the scorer of every configuration returned for `scorer_ids` |
| Scorer list (`3.0/mlflow/scorers/list`) | with `experiment_id` | READ on the experiment; the result then omits every scorer the caller holds `NO_PERMISSIONS` on |
| | without `experiment_id` (all active experiments) | any authenticated user; each scorer is listed only with READ on its experiment and, when the scorer has a grant of its own, READ on the scorer. A scorer whose permission cannot be resolved is omitted |
| Gateway budgets (`3.0/mlflow/gateway/budgets/get`, `list`, `windows`) | read | admin only (writes already were) |
| Demo data (`ajax-api/3.0/mlflow/demo/generate`, `demo/delete`) | `POST` | admin only |

Review queues and label schemas follow the rules of MLflow's own auth plugin. A queue's owner
is its `created_by` and its assigned users are its `users`, both as MLflow stores them, and
both are compared case-insensitively. A queue with no owner recorded is owned by nobody. Owning
a queue adds to EDIT; it never stands in for it.

A custom review queue may not use a registered username (a user or service account, compared
case-insensitively) as its name, on create or on rename, because user queues are named after
their user. This applies to administrators too. A request that breaks the rule gets `400`; a
non-admin without the permission for the operation gets `403` first.

## Job API

MLflow's FastAPI job API (`/ajax-api/3.0/jobs/…`) records the user who submitted a job as its
creator. Jobs on this API carry no experiment, so the creator is the boundary, as in MLflow's own
auth plugin. Admins are not restricted.

| Route | Permission required |
|---|---|
| `POST jobs/` (submit) | depends on the job function in `job_name`, see below; the caller is recorded as the creator |
| `GET jobs/<job_id>`, `PATCH jobs/cancel/<job_id>` | the caller is the job's creator; a job that does not exist or has no recorded creator is refused |
| `POST jobs/search` | any authenticated user; the results contain only the jobs the caller created |

A submission is authorized against the resources its `params` name. Every experiment the job
acts on needs EDIT, whether named directly or through a run or trace in the params. A trace,
run or dataset that cannot be resolved is refused.

| `job_name` | Permission required |
|---|---|
| `invoke_scorer` | EDIT on `experiment_id` and on the experiment of every trace in `trace_ids`; `username`, if given, must be the caller |
| `run_online_trace_scorer`, `run_online_session_scorer` | EDIT on `experiment_id` and on every scorer named in `online_scorers` |
| `invoke_issue_detection` | EDIT on `experiment_id`, on the experiment of `run_id` and of every trace in `trace_ids`; USE on the endpoint when `model` is a gateway model (`gateway:/<endpoint>`; leading slashes in the name are ignored, as MLflow ignores them); a malformed `model` is refused |
| `invoke_genai_evaluate` | EDIT on the experiment of `run_id`, of every trace in `trace_ids`, and on `experiment_id` if given; `username`, if given, must be the caller |
| `optimize_prompts` | EDIT on `experiment_id` and on the experiment of `run_id`; EDIT on the prompt in `prompt_uri` (`prompts:/<name>/<version>` or `prompts:/<name>@<alias>`), which the job registers a new version of; READ on every experiment linked to `dataset_id`, if given |
| any other job function | admin only |

A parameter the job function does not declare, or a value of the wrong type, is refused.

The UI jobs under `ajax-api/3.0/mlflow/jobs/…` are a separate family, authorized through their
experiment (see [Experiment-scoped GenAI routes](#experiment-scoped-genai-routes)).

## Permission Cascade on Delete/Rename

When resources are deleted or renamed, associated permissions are automatically updated:

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Delete registered model | All user and group permissions for that model are deleted |
| Delete scorer | All scorer permissions are deleted |
| Delete gateway endpoint/secret/model definition | All associated permissions are deleted |
| Rename registered model | All permission records are updated to the new name |
| Rename gateway endpoint | All endpoint permission records are updated to the new name |
| Delete workspace | All workspace permissions are deleted, cache is flushed |

## Gateway Permissions

AI Gateway resources (endpoints, secrets, model definitions) use the same permission system as experiments and models. Permission sources (user, group, regex, group-regex) are evaluated in the same order.

Gateway permissions are managed through:
- **Admin UI**: The gateway section (when `OIDC_GEN_AI_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true`)
- **REST API**: `/api/2.0/mlflow/permissions/gateways/` endpoints
- **Before-request hooks**: Enforce permissions on all gateway operations

### MLflow's gateway page for non-admins

MLflow's own AI Gateway page (`/#/gateway` in the MLflow UI, not this plugin's admin UI) calls
two configuration routes on load. Both are readable by any authenticated user; neither returns
a secret value or a resource belonging to anyone else:

| Route | What MLflow returns | What a non-admin receives |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /ajax-api/3.0/mlflow/gateway/provider-config?provider=…` | A static catalogue for one provider: its auth modes and the *names* of the secret and config fields it needs. Built from LiteLLM metadata; reads no stored data. | Unchanged. Needed to render the create-secret form, and creating gateway resources is already open to authenticated users. |
| `GET /ajax-api/3.0/mlflow/gateway/secrets/config` | Two server-wide flags: `secrets_available` and `using_default_passphrase`. No per-secret data. | `{"secrets_available": …}` only. `using_default_passphrase` says whether stored secrets are encrypted under MLflow's well-known default passphrase — operator information the page does not use — so it is removed, as is any field a future MLflow release adds. |

The page shows only its setup guide unless `secrets_available` is `true`, so returning 403
(or an empty body) here left the page blank for non-admins. With these routes readable, the
page lists exactly the endpoints `ListGatewayEndpoints` returns for the user — the ones they
hold `READ` or better on, from any source. Which secrets and model definitions they see is
still decided per resource by the list filters and `Get*` validators above.

Admins receive both responses unchanged. **Configuration writes stay admin-only:**
`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` on either path return 403 for non-admins. MLflow registers
these routes as `GET` only today; the write bindings exist so that a writer added by a future
MLflow release is denied by default instead of being reachable by every authenticated user.

## GraphQL Authorization

The plugin enforces permissions on MLflow's GraphQL API (`/graphql`) through a custom middleware:

- **Protected operations**: `mlflowGetExperiment`, `mlflowGetRun`, `mlflowListArtifacts`, `mlflowSearchRuns`, `mlflowSearchDatasets`, `mlflowSearchModelVersions`, and related fields
- **Behavior**: Returns `null` for unauthorized fields (does not raise errors)
- **Nested model versions**: `modelVersions` on a run (and on a model-version search response) lists only the versions whose registered model the caller can READ. The run's experiment must also be readable. A version whose model permission cannot be resolved is left out
- **Admin users**: Bypass all GraphQL authorization checks

## Workspace Permissions

For workspace-specific permission behavior, see [Workspaces](workspaces).

Key points:
- Workspace permissions serve a dual role: workspace access control **and** resource-level fallback
- When workspaces are enabled, `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION` is not used as a resource fallback — workspace permissions take that role
- With `MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES=true` and `OIDC_WORKSPACE_DEFAULT_PERMISSION=EDIT`, users can update existing experiments/models through workspace fallback but cannot create new experiments/models (creation requires workspace `MANAGE`)
- All workspace-isolated resources (experiments, models, webhooks, trash) are automatically scoped to the active workspace

## De-provisioning

Deactivating a user — through SCIM (`PATCH active:false`) or the admin API
(`PATCH /api/2.0/mlflow/users/{username}/active`) — does not touch their permission grants.
`users.active` is set to false, every live session is revoked, and **all of the user's access
tokens are deleted**, all in the same transaction. The account row and **every permission grant
are kept**. Reactivation does not bring the deleted tokens back; it restores access with no
re-granting once the user signs in again or is issued a new access token, and their prior grants
apply exactly as before.

On deactivation and on hard delete, the plugin looks for resources where the departing user was
the **last holder of `MANAGE`** across experiments, registered models, prompts, scorers, gateway
endpoints, model definitions, secrets, and workspaces, and emits a `resource.orphaned` audit event
per resource.

The departing user's resources are the ones they hold `MANAGE` on **directly** or **through a
group**; `detail.via` on the event says which (`"direct"` or `"group:<name>"`). A resource they could
manage only through a regex grant is not enumerated: a pattern matches resources in MLflow, including
ones that do not exist yet.

Another user still holds the resource, so it is **not** orphaned, when that user is active, is not
the departing user, and their permission on it resolves to `MANAGE`. That permission is resolved the
way it is at request time, by replaying `PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER`: the first source that has an answer
decides. The sources are:

| Source | Answer |
|---|---|
| `user` | the user's direct grant on the resource |
| `group` | the most permissive grant any of the user's groups holds on it |
| `regex` | the user's own patterns |
| `group-regex` | the patterns of the user's groups |

Some consequences under the default order (`user,group,regex,group-regex`):

- A colleague with a direct `READ` grant is **not** a holder, even if one of their groups holds
  `MANAGE`, or one of their patterns says `MANAGE`.
- A colleague with a direct `MANAGE` grant is a holder, even if one of their groups only reads.
- A group in which the departing user was the **last active member** holds nothing. Resources the
  departing user managed only through that group are reported as `via: "group:<name>"`.

Patterns resolve as they do at request time. They are tried in priority order and the first match
wins; for workspaces, the most permissive of the best-priority matches wins. Each pattern is matched
against the same value the resolver uses:

- experiments: the experiment **name**
- registered models and prompts: the name, using model patterns for models and prompt patterns for
  prompts
- scorers: the scorer name
- gateway resources and workspaces: their name

Experiment names and the model-or-prompt distinction come from MLflow. With workspaces enabled, each
lookup is tried in every workspace. A name that is a model in one workspace and a prompt in another
must be held as both. At most 1000 store calls are made per resource type. When the answer depends on
a lookup that fails, the resource is reported with `via: "unresolved"` and a warning is logged, and it
is **never** handed over. Administrators are not counted, because an administrator can always recover
a resource.

When `ORPHAN_FALLBACK_PRINCIPAL` names an active user, a hard delete also grants that user `MANAGE`
on each orphaned resource, except unresolved ones. Deactivation never transfers, since a deactivated
user may come back. Orphan detection never blocks the deprovisioning itself: a failure there is
logged, not raised.

See [SCIM Provisioning](scim#deprovisioning) for the full mechanics and [Admin UI](admin-ui#user-and-group-lifecycle)
for the UI actions.

## Configuration

```bash
# Permission source evaluation order (default)
PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER=user,group,regex,group-regex

# Default permission when no explicit permission found (workspaces disabled)
DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=NO_PERMISSIONS
```

### Common Configurations

```bash
# Security-first: deny by default, require explicit grants
DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=NO_PERMISSIONS
PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER=user,group,regex,group-regex

# Group-priority: check group permissions first
PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER=group,user,group-regex,regex
DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=READ

# Regex-first: pattern-based permissions take priority
PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER=regex,group-regex,user,group
DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=READ
```

## Migrating to deny-by-default

> **The shipped `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION` changes from `MANAGE` to `NO_PERMISSIONS` in the next major version** ([#293](https://github.com/mlflow-oidc/mlflow-oidc-auth/issues/293)).

### What changes, and for whom

`DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION` decides access when a resource has **no** user, group, regex or group-regex grant. Today it ships as `MANAGE`, so a fresh install is open by default: every authenticated user can read, edit and delete every experiment and registered model until grants exist.

You are affected only if **all** of the following hold:

- you do **not** set `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION` explicitly, **and**
- workspaces are disabled (`MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES=false`), **and**
- some users reach resources through the fallback rather than through a grant

With workspaces enabled the global default is not used as a resource fallback at all — workspace permissions take that role — so workspace deployments are unaffected.

### Pinning current behaviour

If you want no change at all, set the value explicitly before upgrading:

```bash
DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=MANAGE
```

This is supported and will keep working. The change is to the *default*, not to the option.

### Migrating properly (recommended)

**1. Find out how much access is coming from the fallback.** Every permission decision made by the default is logged, and grants are warned about:

```
WARNING DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION granted MANAGE on experiment=12 to alice
        because no explicit permission exists (1 such grants for experiment so far)
```

Warnings are throttled (occurrences 1, 10, 100, 1000, …), so treat them as a signal to investigate, not a count. Enable `DEBUG` logging to see every occurrence with its resource and user.

**2. Create the grants those users actually need.** For each resource that showed up, grant explicitly — to a user, a group, or a name-regex rule. Group and regex grants scale better than per-user ones:

```bash
# via the UI:  Permissions → Experiments / Models
# or the REST API under /oidc/api/
```

**3. Verify with the default already lowered**, in staging:

```bash
DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=NO_PERMISSIONS
```

Anything still reachable is reachable because of a real grant. Anything that breaks was relying on the fallback and needs a grant from step 2.

**4. Upgrade.** With the value set explicitly, or with the grants in place, the new default is a no-op for you.

### If you upgrade without migrating

Users lose access to resources they had no explicit grant for, and see `403`. Nothing is deleted and no permission records change — set `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=MANAGE` to restore the previous behaviour immediately while you work through the steps above.

### Why this is changing

Open-by-default is a reasonable *adoption* choice — install the plugin and nothing breaks — but it is the wrong default for a plugin whose purpose is multi-tenant isolation. It also silently defeats `RESTRICT_RESOURCE_CREATION`: with a permissive default, that flag denies nothing (the plugin now warns at startup when this combination is configured).

## Examples

### Direct User Permission

```
User: alice
Resource: experiment_123
Sources checked (in PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER):
  1. user: EDIT permission found → stop
Result: EDIT
```

### Group Inheritance

```
User: bob (member of dev-team, qa-team)
Resource: experiment_456
Sources checked:
  1. user: no permission found
  2. group: dev-team has MANAGE, qa-team has READ → highest wins
Result: MANAGE
```

Where a membership came from does not affect resolution. A user can be in one group because
the directory put them there (SCIM), in another because their login's claims say so, and in a
third because an administrator added them. Each group grants what it grants. The source is
recorded on the membership only to decide who may remove it. See
[Row ownership](configuration#group-membership).

### Regex Pattern Match

```
User: charlie
Resource: prod-model-v1
Sources checked:
  1. user: no permission found
  2. group: no permission found
  3. regex: pattern "^prod-.*" → NO_PERMISSIONS (priority 1, matches first)
Result: NO_PERMISSIONS (access denied)
```

### Fallback to Default (Workspaces Disabled)

```
User: diana
Resource: new-experiment
Sources checked:
  1. user: not found
  2. group: not found
  3. regex: no matching patterns
  4. group-regex: no matching patterns
  5. Fallback: DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION
Result: MANAGE (from default)
```

### Workspace Fallback (Workspaces Enabled)

```
User: diana
Resource: new-experiment (in workspace "data-team")
Diana has READ permission on workspace "data-team"
Sources checked:
  1. user: not found
  2. group: not found
  3. regex: no matching patterns
  4. group-regex: no matching patterns
  5. Workspace fallback: diana has READ on "data-team"
Result: READ (from workspace fallback)
```

## Resource Creation Authorization

By default, any authenticated user can create experiments and registered models — this matches upstream MLflow. Because the resource does not exist yet at creation time, the usual per-resource permission (keyed by experiment id or model name) cannot apply, so creation was historically unguarded.

Set `RESTRICT_RESOURCE_CREATION=true` to require **EDIT** (`can_update`) or higher to create a resource. Since the resource is new, only **name-based** sources are consulted:

1. `regex` — the user's own regex patterns matched against the new resource name
2. `group-regex` — the user's groups' regex patterns matched against the new resource name
3. Fallback when neither matches:
   - **Workspaces disabled** → the global `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION`
   - **Workspaces enabled** → the user's permission on the request workspace (deny if they have none)

> ⚠️ **The default `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION` is `MANAGE`, which grants `can_update`.** In a non-workspace deployment, enabling `RESTRICT_RESOURCE_CREATION` alone does **nothing** — a name that matches no regex falls back to `MANAGE` and creation is still allowed. To actually restrict creation you must either lower `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION` below `EDIT` (e.g. `NO_PERMISSIONS`) so only regex/group-regex matches can create, or rely on the workspace gate. Setting the flag without doing one of these gives a false sense of lockdown.

This closes a real gap in non-workspace deployments: with a project-prefix scheme like `<project>/<name>`, a user granted `^team-a/.*` could still create `team-b/whatever` (e.g. via a typo) and end up owning a resource they cannot subsequently access.

### Interaction with workspaces

When workspaces are enabled, creation is *also* subject to the workspace creation gate (workspace `MANAGE`, plus `OIDC_WORKSPACE_REQUIRE_CREATION_CONTEXT` / `OIDC_WORKSPACE_DENY_DEFAULT_CREATION`). The two checks compose as **AND** — a create must satisfy *both*. Enabling `RESTRICT_RESOURCE_CREATION` therefore never grants more than the workspace gate alone; it only ever adds restriction. If you run with workspaces, the workspace gate is the primary control and `RESTRICT_RESOURCE_CREATION` is optional.

### Affected endpoints

| Endpoint | Effect when restricted |
|----------|------------------------|
| `CreateExperiment` | Requires EDIT+ for the new experiment name |
| `CreateRegisteredModel` | Requires EDIT+ for the new model name |

Child resources (`CreateRun`, `CreateModelVersion`, …) are unaffected — they inherit permission from their parent.
