# Configuration Reference

The application is configured through environment variables, `.env` files, or pluggable secret providers (AWS, Azure, Vault, Kubernetes). See [Configuration Providers](configuration-providers) for cloud-specific setup.

## Environment Variables

### OIDC Authentication

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL` | String | *Required* | OIDC discovery endpoint URL (e.g., `https://idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`) |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | String | *Required* | Client ID registered with your OIDC provider |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | String | *Required unless `OIDC_PUBLIC_CLIENT`* | Client secret for your OIDC application. Leave it unset only for a client declared public with `OIDC_PUBLIC_CLIENT=true` — see [Public clients](#public-clients). Unset without that declaration, the client is not registered and an error names it |
| `OIDC_PUBLIC_CLIENT` | Boolean | `false` | Declare the client a **public client**: one the provider issued without a client secret. It is registered with no secret, and PKCE (`OIDC_CODE_CHALLENGE`, on by default) authenticates the token exchange instead. Requires PKCE, and refuses an `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` set alongside it — both are errors that leave the client unregistered. See [Public clients](#public-clients) |
| `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` | String | Auto-detected | Redirect URI for the OIDC callback (`/callback`). If not set, calculated dynamically from proxy headers, which works correctly behind reverse proxies |
| `OIDC_SCOPE` | String | `openid,email,profile` | Comma-separated list of OIDC scopes to request |
| `OIDC_AUDIENCE` | String | None | Expected JWT `aud` claim value (e.g., your client ID or API identifier). When set, bearer tokens are rejected if the `aud` claim doesn't match. Recommended for production to prevent token confusion attacks |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | String | None | Expected JWT `iss` claim value. When set, tokens whose issuer does not match are rejected. Also a required precondition for `OIDC_PROVISION_ON_BEARER_AUTH` |
| `OIDC_PROVISION_ON_BEARER_AUTH` | Boolean | `false` | Auto-create a permission record on first bearer-token authentication for API-first users who never logged in via the browser (fixes ownerless resources, issue #262). Requires **both** `OIDC_AUDIENCE` and `OIDC_ISSUER` set. Provisioned users are **non-admin** and must pass the same group-authorization gate as interactive login. **Note:** unlike browser login (which reads groups from the ID token, or from the UserInfo endpoint with `OIDC_USERINFO_GROUPS` — see [Claims and the UserInfo endpoint](#claims-and-the-userinfo-endpoint)), the bearer path resolves groups from the token itself — the access token must carry the groups claim (or `OIDC_GROUP_DETECTION_PLUGIN` must accept the presented JWT), otherwise the user fails the group gate and is not provisioned (they continue to be denied creation, never silently over-granted) |
| `OIDC_TRUST_BEARER_GROUP_CLAIMS` | Boolean | `false` | Whether a bearer token may confer **admin** (via `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP_NAME` membership in its group claim). Default false: admin is never granted from a token. Only enable if the IdP — not the token subject — controls the groups claim on audience-restricted tokens |
| `OIDC_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAME` | String | `Login with OIDC` | Display name shown on the login page button |
| `OIDC_GROUPS_ATTRIBUTE` | String | `groups` | Claim that contains the user's group memberships, read from the ID token — or, with `OIDC_USERINFO_GROUPS`, from the UserInfo response when the ID token lacks it (see [Claims and the UserInfo endpoint](#claims-and-the-userinfo-endpoint)) |
| `OIDC_USERINFO_GROUPS` | Boolean | `false` | Let the groups claim (`OIDC_GROUPS_ATTRIBUTE`) and the workspace claim (`OIDC_WORKSPACE_CLAIM_NAME`) be read from the provider's UserInfo endpoint when the ID token lacks them. Off by default: those claims decide who may log in, who is an administrator and which workspaces a user joins, so they come from the ID token alone unless you opt in. Identity claims are completed from UserInfo either way. Registry equivalent: `userinfo_groups`. See [Claims and the UserInfo endpoint](#claims-and-the-userinfo-endpoint) |
| `OIDC_USERNAME_FIELD` | String | `email,preferred_username` | Comma-separated list of userinfo/token claim names tried in order to resolve the login identity. The first non-empty string field wins and is lowercased. Use this when your IdP shouldn't be identified by email (e.g. it may be reassigned) or when you want a stable claim like `sub` instead. **Note:** leaving this effectively empty logs a startup warning — no login or bearer-token authentication could ever resolve a username |
| `OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME_FIELD` | String | `name` | Comma-separated list of userinfo/token claim names tried in order to resolve the human-readable display name shown in the UI. The first non-empty string field wins. **Note:** leaving this effectively empty logs a startup warning — no login could ever resolve a display name |
| `OIDC_SESSION_EXPIRY_LEEWAY_SECONDS` | Integer | `30` | Clock-skew leeway applied to the IdP-issued token expiry. Sessions are rejected once `now >= expires_at - leeway`, forcing the user back through the OIDC login flow so IdP-side changes (deactivation, group changes, MFA enrollment) take effect within the token's lifetime instead of waiting for the cookie TTL |
| `OIDC_USE_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Boolean | `false` | When `true`, request `offline_access` and persist the refresh token in the session so expired sessions are silently refreshed against the IdP without forcing a visible login. Disabled by default because many enterprises require additional approval for `offline_access`. The refresh token is kept encrypted on the server-side session row, never in the cookie (see [Sessions](#sessions)), and concurrent requests on an expired session exchange it exactly once, so IdPs with refresh-token rotation and reuse detection do not end the session |

### Provider registry fields

Per-provider fields set on an entry in `AUTH_PROVIDERS` / `AUTH_PROVIDERS_FILE` (a JSON array of provider objects). The flat `OIDC_*` variables above describe a single synthesised `default` provider.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `public_client` | Boolean | `false` | Declare this OIDC provider a **public client**, registered without a client secret and authenticated by PKCE instead. The same rules as `OIDC_PUBLIC_CLIENT`: requires PKCE, and refuses a secret (`OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_<PROVIDER_ID>`) configured alongside it. Without it, a provider with no secret is not registered. Accepted only on `oidc` providers; set on `saml` or `k8s` the entry is refused at load. Must be a JSON boolean (`"true"` is refused). For the synthesised `default` provider it comes from `OIDC_PUBLIC_CLIENT`. See [Public clients](#public-clients) |
| `userinfo_groups` | Boolean | `false` | `oidc` providers only. Let this provider's UserInfo endpoint supply the groups and workspace claims when the ID token lacks them. The same rules as `OIDC_USERINFO_GROUPS`, which sets it for the synthesised `default` provider. Must be a JSON `true` or `false` (a string such as `"true"` is rejected), and is rejected on a `saml` or `k8s` provider. See [Claims and the UserInfo endpoint](#claims-and-the-userinfo-endpoint) |
| `interactive` | Boolean | `true` for `oidc` and `saml`, `false` for `k8s` | Whether the provider carries a browser login and appears on the login page. Set `false` on an `oidc` provider that only issues tokens to workloads — a service principal's client-credentials tokens or a CI workload-identity issuer. A bearer token from a non-interactive provider authenticates normally but is refused (`403`) by every endpoint that issues an access token. Must be a JSON boolean; `true` on a `k8s` provider is refused at load. See [Programmatic access](programmatic-access#idp-client-credentials-and-workload-identity) |
| `allow_tokens_without_expiry` | Boolean | `false` | Accept a bearer token that carries no `exp` claim. By default every provider — including the synthesised `default` one — refuses such a token, because nothing else would ever make it stop working. Accepted only on token providers (`oidc`, `k8s`); set on `saml` or any other type the entry is refused at load. Must be a JSON boolean (`"true"` is refused). Waives only a *missing* `exp`: a present `exp` in the past, the issuer, the audience and the signature are all still enforced. Setting it logs a warning at startup. Intended for legacy Kubernetes service-account tokens — see [Kubernetes service accounts](kubernetes-auth#tokens-without-an-expiry) |

### SAML provider fields

Fields for an entry with `"type": "saml"` (requires the `[saml]` extra). They are refused on any other type, and a SAML entry refuses the bearer-token fields (`audience`, `issuer`, `discovery_url`, `client_id`, `allowed_algorithms`, `allow_tokens_without_expiry`, and the Kubernetes key fields) as well as `identity_binding: email`. See [SAML Authentication](saml-auth).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `entity_id` | String | **required** | This SP's entity id. Every assertion must name it in an `AudienceRestriction` |
| `idp_entity_id` | String | **required** | The IdP's entity id; the `Issuer` of every Response and assertion must equal it |
| `idp_sso_url` | String (https) | required unless `idp_metadata_url` supplies it | The IdP's HTTP-Redirect SingleSignOnService |
| `idp_slo_url` | String (https) | None | The IdP's HTTP-Redirect SingleLogoutService. Without it `/logout` ends only the local session and IdP-initiated logout is refused |
| `idp_x509_cert` | String or list | required unless `idp_metadata_url` supplies it | The IdP's signing certificate(s), PEM or bare base64. A list accepts any of them, for a rotation |
| `idp_metadata_url` | String (https) | None | IdP metadata, fetched once at startup (10 s timeout, 1 MiB, no redirects) to fill whichever of the certificate and endpoints are not configured. A failed fetch drops the provider |
| `sp_x509_cert` | String | None | This SP's signing certificate, published in its metadata. Must match the private key |
| `sp_private_key` | String | None | Unencrypted RSA private key (PEM) for `sp_x509_cert`. Never logged. Mutually exclusive with `sp_private_key_file` |
| `sp_private_key_file` | String | None | Path to that key, read at startup |
| `sign_requests` | Boolean | `false` | Sign AuthnRequests, LogoutRequests and LogoutResponses (RSA-SHA256). Requires the SP certificate and key |
| `want_assertions_signed` | Boolean | `true` | Require the assertion itself to be signed |
| `want_response_signed` | Boolean | `false` | Require the enclosing Response to be signed. At least one of the two must be `true` |
| `clock_skew_seconds` | Integer | `60` | Allowance on the assertion's `NotBefore` / `NotOnOrAfter`, 0–300 |
| `name_id_format` | String | `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress` | The `NameIDPolicy` format requested |
| `attribute_username` | String | `email` | Attribute naming the local account; falls back to the NameID |
| `attribute_groups` | String | `groups` | Attribute carrying group names |
| `attribute_display_name` | String | `displayName` | Attribute carrying the display name |

### Group and Access Control

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `OIDC_GROUP_NAME` | String | `mlflow` | Comma-separated list of allowed groups. Users must belong to at least one of these groups (or an admin group) to log in. **Note:** leaving this effectively empty logs a startup warning — no user could ever be recognized as a member of an allowed group |
| `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP_NAME` | String | `mlflow-admin` | Comma-separated list of admin groups. Members have full admin privileges and bypass all permission checks. **Note:** leaving this effectively empty logs a startup warning — no user could ever be granted admin access via group membership |
| `OIDC_GROUP_DETECTION_PLUGIN` | String | None | Python module path for a custom group detection plugin. When set, groups are extracted from the access token using this plugin instead of the ID token's groups attribute. The plugin must expose `get_user_groups(access_token)`. If its signature also declares a `token_response` parameter (or accepts `**kwargs`), it is additionally called with `token_response=` — on interactive login this is the full authlib token response (`id_token`, `access_token`, `userinfo`, etc.); on the bearer-token path it is `{"access_token": <token>, "claims": <validated JWT claims>}`. Detected once per plugin via `inspect.signature` and cached, so a plugin written against the original single-argument signature keeps working unchanged (issue #250) |

### Permissions

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION` | String | `MANAGE` | Default permission level when no explicit permission is found. Options: `READ`, `USE`, `EDIT`, `MANAGE`, `NO_PERMISSIONS`. See [Permissions](permissions) |
| `PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER` | String | `user,group,regex,group-regex` | Comma-separated order for evaluating permission sources. The first source with a matching permission wins. See [Permissions](permissions#permission-source-order) |
| `RESTRICT_RESOURCE_CREATION` | Boolean | `false` | When enabled, require EDIT+ permission (via name regex / group-regex, with a workspace fallback) to create experiments and registered models. **Note:** ineffective on its own if `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION` is left at the default `MANAGE` — lower it below `EDIT` (or use workspaces) to actually restrict creation. Off by default, matching upstream MLflow. See [Resource Creation Authorization](permissions#resource-creation-authorization) |

### Database

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `OIDC_USERS_DB_URI` | String | `sqlite:///auth.db` | Database connection URI for user/permission storage. Supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and any SQLAlchemy-compatible database |
| `OIDC_ALEMBIC_VERSION_TABLE` | String | `alembic_version` | Alembic migration version table name. Change this if you need to avoid conflicts with other Alembic-managed schemas in the same database |

### Security

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | String | Auto-generated | Secret key used to sign session cookies. **All replicas must share the same value** in multi-instance deployments. If not set, a random key is generated on startup and a warning is logged — sessions will not survive restarts or work across replicas |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` | String (CSV) | Empty (trust no proxy) | Comma-separated list of trusted proxy IP addresses or CIDR ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12`). `X-Forwarded-*` and `X-Real-IP` headers are honoured only from a connecting client inside one of these ranges and ignored from every other client; a value with no valid entry trusts no client. When empty, no proxy is trusted: the headers are ignored from every client and this is logged once at startup. **A deployment behind a reverse proxy must set this** to the proxy's address or range — see [Reverse proxies](#reverse-proxies) |
| `AUTOMATIC_LOGIN_REDIRECT` | Boolean | `false` | When `true`, unauthenticated browser requests are automatically redirected to the OIDC login page instead of showing the login UI |

### UI Behavior

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `EXTEND_MLFLOW_MENU` | Boolean | `true` | Inject sign-in/sign-out links and permission management navigation into MLflow's built-in UI |
| `EXTEND_MLFLOW_REAUTH` | Boolean | `true` | Inject a small script into MLflow's UI that triggers a full page reload on any 401 response. Without this, an expired session leaves the SPA rendering empty pages until a manual force-reload, because React Router intercepts URL-bar navigations as soft routing |
| `DEFAULT_LANDING_PAGE_IS_PERMISSIONS` | Boolean | `true` | Use the permissions management page as the default landing page in the admin UI |

### Feature Flags

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `OIDC_GEN_AI_GATEWAY_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | Enable AI Gateway permission management in the admin UI and API. Disable if you don't use MLflow AI Gateway |
| `MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES` | Boolean | `false` | Enable workspace (multi-tenant) support. Requires MLflow >=3.10. See [Workspaces](workspaces) |
| `ENABLE_API_DOCS` | Boolean | `true` | Enable OpenAPI documentation at `/openapi.json`, Swagger UI at `/docs`, and ReDoc at `/redoc` |

### Caching

The plugin uses TTL caches to avoid repeated database lookups on every request. Two independent caches exist: one for OIDC/JWT key material and one for permission resolution results.

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `OIDC_JWKS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Integer | `300` | Time-to-live (seconds) for the JWKS key set cache. The OIDC provider's signing keys are fetched once and cached for this duration. This is always a local in-process cache (not affected by `CACHE_BACKEND`) because JWKS data is identical across replicas |
| `OIDC_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Integer | `10` | Timeout (seconds) applied to OIDC discovery and JWKS HTTP fetches. Set lower for faster failover when the IdP is unreachable; without a timeout a hung IdP can block request threads until the OS-level TCP timeout (~2 minutes), causing cascading auth failures |
| `OIDC_VERIFY_SSL` | Boolean | `true` | Verify the OIDC provider's TLS certificate on discovery, JWKS, and token requests. Only set to `false` for providers using self-signed certificates in a trusted network. Certificates are checked against the operating system's trust store, so a private or TLS-inspection root CA installed system-wide is trusted (see *Outbound HTTPS trusts the operating system's certificate store* under Upgrading) |
| `OIDC_CODE_CHALLENGE` | String | `S256` | PKCE code-challenge method for the authorization-code flow. `S256` (or `true`/`yes`/`on`/`1`), or `none`/`off`/`false`/`no`/`0` to disable. An unrecognised value warns and falls back to `S256`. See [PKCE](#pkce) |
| `MANAGED_BY_ENFORCEMENT` | String | `report` | What happens when one source writes a row another owns: `off`, `report` (audit only) or `enforce`. See [Row ownership](#row-ownership) |
| `PERMISSION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Integer | `30` | Time-to-live (seconds) for the permission resolution cache. Cached permission decisions expire after this duration. Lower values mean faster propagation of permission changes; higher values reduce database load |
| `CACHE_BACKEND` | String | `local` | Cache backend for permission and workspace caches. Options: `local` (in-process TTL cache) or `redis` (shared Redis instance). Use `redis` for multi-replica deployments where permission changes must propagate immediately across all replicas |
| `CACHE_REDIS_URL` | String | None | Redis connection URL. Required when `CACHE_BACKEND=redis`. Example: `redis://localhost:6379/0` or `redis://:password@redis-host:6379/1` |
| `CACHE_KEY_PREFIX` | String | `mlflow_oidc_auth:` | Key prefix for Redis cache entries. Useful when sharing a Redis instance with other applications |

> **Note:** Permission caches are automatically invalidated when permissions are created, updated, or deleted through the plugin's API. The TTL acts as a safety net, not the primary invalidation mechanism.

> **Compatibility:** Any Redis-protocol-compatible server works — including [Valkey](https://valkey.io/), [Dragonfly](https://www.dragonflydb.io/), and [KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/). The plugin uses standard Redis commands (`GET`, `SET`, `DELETE`, `SCAN`) via the `redis-py` client library.

### Workspace Settings

These settings only apply when `MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES=true`.

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `OIDC_WORKSPACE_DEFAULT_PERMISSION` | String | `NO_PERMISSIONS` | Permission level auto-assigned to users for workspaces detected during OIDC login |
| `OIDC_WORKSPACE_CLAIM_NAME` | String | `workspace` | OIDC token claim name used for workspace detection during login |
| `OIDC_WORKSPACE_DETECTION_PLUGIN` | String | None | Python module path for a custom workspace detection plugin. Used to extract workspace assignments from the OIDC token |
| `OIDC_WORKSPACE_REQUIRE_CREATION_CONTEXT` | Boolean | `false` | Reject workspace-gated create requests when no workspace context is present |
| `OIDC_WORKSPACE_DENY_DEFAULT_CREATION` | Boolean | `false` | Reject non-admin workspace-gated create requests that resolve to the `default` workspace, including requests that send no workspace context |
| `WORKSPACE_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` | Integer | `1024` | Maximum number of entries in the workspace permission cache |
| `WORKSPACE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Integer | `300` | Time-to-live (seconds) for workspace permission cache entries |

### SCIM

SCIM 2.0 provisioning at `/scim/v2`. It does nothing until an administrator issues a SCIM
token. See [SCIM Provisioning](scim).

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `SCIM_TOKEN_ROTATION_OVERLAP_SECONDS` | Integer | `3600` | How long a rotated SCIM token keeps working next to its replacement |
| `SCIM_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | Integer | `600` | Requests per minute allowed for each SCIM token, counted **per process** (N replicas allow up to N times this). `0` disables the limit |
| `SCIM_AUTH_FAILURE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | Integer | `60` | Failed SCIM authentications allowed per client IP per minute before `429`. Counted per process, like the rate limit. `0` disables it |
| `SCIM_ACTIVITY_RETENTION_DAYS` | Integer | `30` | Days of SCIM activity kept for the provisioning status. Older rows are deleted by `mlflow-oidc db prune-sessions` and hourly by the server. `0` keeps everything. See [Provisioning status](scim#provisioning-status-and-activity) |
| `SCIM_ACTIVITY_HEALTHY_WINDOW_SECONDS` | Integer | `86400` | Provisioning counts as healthy while a SCIM request succeeded within this many seconds |
| `ORPHAN_FALLBACK_PRINCIPAL` | String | None | Username that receives `MANAGE` on resources a hard-deleted user was the last manager of. When unset, orphans are only reported as `resource.orphaned` audit events |
| `USER_RETENTION_DAYS` | Integer | `0` | Reserved for a future purge of deactivated users. `0` means never; nothing reads it yet |

### Logging

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | String | `INFO` | Application log level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) |
| `LOGGING_LOGGER_NAME` | String | `uvicorn` | Logger name to configure. Defaults to the uvicorn logger for FastAPI compatibility |

## Row ownership

`managed_by` records which source a user row belongs to — `manual`, `scim`, or
`oidc:<provider>`. Today only `manual` and `scim` are ever written: a user created by a first SSO
sign-in (OIDC or SAML) is `manual`, and providers never claim ownership. The `oidc:<provider>`
value is reserved for the reconcile CLI and future provider-owned rows. `MANAGED_BY_ENFORCEMENT`
decides what happens when a *different* source tries to write a row:

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `off` | No evaluation at all |
| `report` | **Default.** The conflict is audited as `user.ownership_conflict`, and the write proceeds |
| `enforce` | The write is refused |

It defaults to `report` on purpose. The failure mode of a write guard is lockout, and lockout
cannot be repaired from inside a system that has just refused the write that would repair it —
so the telemetry exists a release before the enforcement does. Run on `report`, look at what
`user.ownership_conflict` events you actually get, then move to `enforce`.

An administrator action is permitted in every mode and always audited. That is deliberate: an
operator who cannot fix ownership without database access has been locked out by the thing that
was supposed to protect them. There are two ways to do it:

```bash
# From the API, as an administrator — the decommissioned-directory case
curl -X PATCH "$MLFLOW/api/2.0/mlflow/users/ownership" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"username": "alice@corp.example", "managed_by": "manual"}'
```

or in bulk with the CLI below, for an operator who has a shell.

### Delete and create

A delete goes through the same guard as an update, before anything else happens. Under `enforce`
a source cannot delete a row it may not write. The admin API needs `"admin_override": true` for
that. The attempt is audited as `user.ownership_conflict` with `detail.operation: "delete"`.

A create never takes over an existing row. When the username exists, the create is refused with
`RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS` in every mode, and the row and its owner stay as they were. When that
row belongs to another source, the attempt is also audited (`operation: "create"`). Together
these rules stop a source from deleting a row it does not own and creating it again as `manual`.

### Group membership

Group membership carries permissions, so each membership (`user_groups` row) records its own
owner:

| Written by | Owner |
|---|---|
| An administrator, or any write from before this was recorded | `manual` |
| SCIM `/Groups` | `scim` |
| A login's claims, bearer provisioning, a service account | `oidc:<provider>` or `saml:<provider>` |

Adding a membership never counts as a cross-source write: the writer owns the new row, and a
membership that already exists keeps its owner. Removing one depends on the membership's owner
and on the kind of write:

| Membership owner | Removed by its own source | By another source's **sync** (login, SCIM `PUT`) | By another source's targeted removal |
|---|---|---|---|
| `manual` | yes | yes | yes, except that SCIM may not remove a hand-made administrator's under `enforce` |
| `scim`, `oidc:*`, `saml:*` | yes | **never, in any mode**; recorded as kept | `report`: yes, audited. `enforce`: refused |

An `authoritative` login therefore revokes its own memberships and every `manual` one, and
leaves SCIM's and other providers' in place in every mode. Every membership that predates this is
`manual`, so revocation keeps working after an upgrade without a backfill, and a deployment that
changes nothing sees no change. Each membership a sync leaves in place is recorded as
`user.ownership_conflict` with `detail.operation: "membership.sync_kept"`, `status: "success"`
and `detail.group`. It is not a denial, so it does not inflate denial counts.
A refused targeted removal is `detail.operation: "membership.remove"` with `status: "denied"`.

A kept row is recorded in every mode, `off` included, where the sync also logs one INFO line
per sync (the user or group, how many rows it kept, and their owners). **A renamed provider
(`oidc:kc` → `oidc:keycloak`) or a move from OIDC to SAML makes that provider's old memberships
foreign to it**, so its syncs keep them instead of revoking them. Hand them to the new source
with `mlflow-oidc db reconcile-ownership --memberships --from-owner <old> --set-owner <new>`.

A sync never fails because a row was kept: failing it would lock the user or the group out of
every future sync. A targeted removal fails with nothing applied (`409` from SCIM).

### Group ownership

Groups record who created them too (`groups.managed_by`): `scim` for SCIM, `oidc:<provider>` /
`saml:<provider>` for a group a login's claims brought into existence (a Kubernetes namespace
group included), and `manual` for everything else, including every group that existed before the
column. Under `enforce` SCIM may write, fill or delete only the groups it owns. See
[SCIM: Group ownership](scim#group-ownership). `reconcile-ownership --groups` hands a group to
another source.

### Changing ownership

Ownership never changes implicitly — not at startup, not when a provider's configuration
changes, not as a side effect of a login. It is an operator action with a diff you read first:

```bash
mlflow-oidc db reconcile-ownership --url "$DB" --from-owner scim --set-owner manual
```

That prints the diff and changes nothing. Add `--apply` to write it, and `--journal FILE` to
record the prior ownership of every row it touches:

```bash
mlflow-oidc db reconcile-ownership --url "$DB" --from-owner scim --set-owner manual --apply --journal /tmp/ownership.json
mlflow-oidc db restore-ownership --url "$DB" --journal /tmp/ownership.json --apply
```

The dry-run diff and the applied diff come from the same query, so what you approve is what
runs. `restore-ownership` is also a dry run without `--apply`.

**This is the repair path when a source is turned off.** Point `--from-owner` at it and
`--set-owner` at `manual`, and the rows it used to own become editable again.

Add `--groups` with `--group NAME` or `--from-owner` to re-own groups instead of user rows, for
example to let a directory manage a group that existed before it. Every filter must apply to the
table being rewritten: `--username` with `--groups`, or `--group` without it, is refused rather
than ignored. `--set-owner` accepts `manual`, `scim`, `oidc:<id>` and `saml:<id>`. Add `--memberships` to re-own
group memberships too. `--from-owner` then matches each
membership's owner, and `--username` the member. The journal records them, and
`restore-ownership` puts them back. From the API, `PATCH /api/2.0/mlflow/users/ownership` with
`"memberships": true` hands all of one user's memberships to the new owner. Without one of these,
the memberships of a source you have turned off cannot be removed by any other source under
`enforce`.

## PKCE

[PKCE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636) is **enabled by default** (`S256`).

It binds the authorization code to a secret that only the login attempt that started the flow
knows, so a code intercepted on its way back — from a browser history entry, a proxy log, a
shared machine, a misconfigured redirect — cannot be exchanged for tokens by whoever intercepted
it. There is no cost to it for a provider that supports it, which is nearly all of them.

**This changed.** Earlier versions left PKCE off unless `OIDC_CODE_CHALLENGE` was set explicitly.
If your provider supports PKCE — Entra ID, Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, Google, and any provider
advertising `code_challenge_methods_supported` all do — nothing is required of you.

If your provider does **not** support it, disable it:

```bash
OIDC_CODE_CHALLENGE=none
```

`none`, `off`, `false`, `no`, `disabled`, `0` and an empty value all disable it, and doing so
logs a warning at startup — so a variable that renders blank from a Helm value or a compose file
cannot quietly turn PKCE off. `true`, `yes`, `on`, `enabled` and `1` all mean `S256`.

Any other value warns and falls back to `S256`, rather than being sent to the provider as a
challenge method it has never heard of. It falls back rather than refusing to start because this
configuration is read by the migration tooling too — a stale value would otherwise block
`mlflow-oidc db upgrade`, which is the upgrade this change asks you to perform.

**How a provider that cannot do PKCE reports itself:**

- If it advertises `code_challenge_methods_supported` in its discovery document and your method
  is not among them, login fails **before** redirecting, with a message naming the provider, the
  methods it does support, and this variable.
- If it advertises nothing (permitted by [RFC 8414](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414)) the
  login proceeds, and a rejected token exchange logs an `invalid_grant` line that names
  `OIDC_CODE_CHALLENGE=none` as the thing to try.

`plain` is **ignored, with a warning, in favour of `S256`**. RFC 7636 defines it, but the pinned
authlib emits a challenge for `S256` only, so a client configured for `plain` sends an
authorization request with no challenge at all — it reported PKCE as enabled while nothing was
bound to the code. If you have `OIDC_CODE_CHALLENGE=plain` set today, it was doing nothing; for
a provider that genuinely offers only `plain`, set `none` so the state is explicit.

> **Note:** with PKCE enabled, authlib logs the per-attempt code verifier at `DEBUG`. It is
> single-use and short-lived, but `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` is not a good idea in production for this
> reason among others.

### Public clients

A **public client** is one the provider issues without a client secret, because there is nowhere
to keep one. Declare it explicitly and leave the secret unset:

```bash
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=mlflow-public
OIDC_PUBLIC_CLIENT=true
# no OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET
```

For a provider in the registry, set `"public_client": true` on its entry and leave
`OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_<PROVIDER_ID>` unset.

The client is then registered with no secret at all. authlib authenticates its token, refresh and
revocation requests with the `none` method — the `client_id` in the request body, no
`Authorization` header — and PKCE is what binds the authorization code to the login attempt. The
secret is left out of the registration rather than set blank, so the `none` method is chosen
because there is no secret, not because of how authlib happens to read an empty one.

The declaration is required. A missing secret on its own is never taken to mean "public client",
because a secret that failed to load from a secrets manager must be reported as missing, not
quietly change how the client authenticates. Registration follows these rules, and every refusal
logs an error naming the provider (never the secret) while the other providers carry on:

| Declared public | Client secret | PKCE | Result |
|-----------------|---------------|------|--------|
| no | set | any | Registered as a confidential client, as before |
| no | unset | any | **Refused**: set the client secret, or declare the client public |
| yes | unset | on | Registered as a public client |
| yes | any | off | **Refused**: a public client needs PKCE (`OIDC_CODE_CHALLENGE`) |
| yes | set | on | **Refused**: contradictory configuration — remove the secret or the declaration |

Each refusal is logged once per provider per process, not on every readiness probe.

A public client's refresh token (with `OIDC_USE_REFRESH_TOKEN`) is redeemable with the
`client_id` alone. It is kept encrypted on the server-side session row either way; if your
provider offers refresh-token rotation, enable it for a public client.

### Claims and the UserInfo endpoint

A browser login reads its claims — the username (`OIDC_USERNAME_FIELD`), the display name
(`OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME_FIELD`), the groups (`OIDC_GROUPS_ATTRIBUTE`) and, with workspaces enabled,
the workspace claim (`OIDC_WORKSPACE_CLAIM_NAME`) — from the **ID token**, after it has been
validated (signature, issuer, audience, expiry, nonce).

Some providers, many academic and eduGAIN ones among them, release email, name or groups only
from the **UserInfo endpoint**. When an **identity** claim — the username or display name — is
missing from the ID token and the provider's discovery document advertises a
`userinfo_endpoint`, the callback calls that endpoint once with the login's access token, through
the same provider's client (same TLS settings and timeouts).

The **groups and workspace claims** decide who may log in, who is an administrator and which
workspaces a user joins, so by default they come from the ID token alone: they are never read
from UserInfo, and a missing one does not cause a UserInfo call. To let UserInfo supply them, set
`OIDC_USERINFO_GROUPS=true` (or `"userinfo_groups": true` on a registry entry). Then a missing
groups claim (without `OIDC_GROUP_DETECTION_PLUGIN`) or workspace claim (with workspaces enabled
and no `OIDC_WORKSPACE_DETECTION_PLUGIN`) also triggers the call, and is filled from the response.

- **Subject binding.** The UserInfo `sub` must equal the ID token's `sub` (OpenID Connect Core
  5.3.2). A response with no `sub` or another one refuses the login. An ID token without a `sub`
  has nothing to bind a response to, so UserInfo is not used for it.
- **Precedence.** The ID token always wins. UserInfo only fills claims the ID token does not
  carry, never replaces one, and never supplies claims describing the authentication itself
  (`iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, `nonce`, `azp`, `at_hash`, `sid`, `auth_time`, `acr`, `amr`
  and similar). `email_verified` is taken from UserInfo only together with `email`.
- **Username stability.** When the ID token yields a username, that username is used even if
  UserInfo carries a higher-priority `OIDC_USERNAME_FIELD` claim, so completing other claims never
  moves a user to a different account.
- **Failure.** If the call fails — network error, non-2xx status, or a body that is not a JSON
  object (a signed or encrypted `application/jwt` response is not accepted) — the login continues
  with the ID token's claims, and fails as before if those are not enough.

Bearer-token authentication does not call the UserInfo endpoint; it reads the claims of the
presented token.

## Sessions

Browser sessions are **server-side**: a row in the `auth_sessions` table of the auth database.
The cookie carries only an opaque identifier, so a session can be ended by the server rather
than merely forgotten by the browser.

- The identifier is resolved against the database on **every** request, uncached, so revoking a
  session takes effect on the next request — no TTL to wait out
- Deactivating or deleting a user revokes their live sessions immediately, and records a
  `session.revoked` audit event
- Logging out revokes the row. If revocation fails, logout returns **503** rather than
  reporting success, because a cleared cookie does not end a session that is still live
- Logging out also ends the session at the provider that opened it: RP-initiated logout goes to
  *that* OIDC provider's `end_session_endpoint` (with its own `id_token_hint`), or SAML single
  logout for a SAML session; a provider without one gets a local logout only. With
  `OIDC_USE_REFRESH_TOKEN`, the stored refresh token is first revoked at the provider's RFC 7009
  `revocation_endpoint` when its discovery document advertises one, so the `offline_access` grant
  does not outlive the logout. This is best effort with a 5-second limit: a failure is logged and
  audited as `auth.token_revocation_failed`, and never blocks the logout
- The cookie is still signed with `SECRET_KEY` — all replicas **must** share the same key, and
  it must be set explicitly for sessions to survive a restart
- The cookie is signed but **not** encrypted; nothing secret belongs in it

**Provider tokens live on the session row, encrypted — not in the cookie.** The IdP-issued expiry,
the ID token (offered as `id_token_hint` at RP-initiated logout) and, with
`OIDC_USE_REFRESH_TOKEN`, the refresh token are stored in `auth_sessions.encrypted_tokens`
(Fernet). The cookie carries only the session id. A silent refresh is **single-flight**: however
many requests find the session expired at once, one exchanges the refresh token and the rest
adopt its result, so a rotated refresh token is never replayed. Cookies from an earlier release
may still carry `refresh_token` / `expires_at`: the refresh token is dropped on the next request
and never used. For a session opened by an earlier release (its row holds no tokens) the cookie's
`expires_at` is still honoured as the IdP expiry — once it passes, the user logs in again — and
is removed at the next login.

**Rotating keys.** Without `SESSION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` the encryption key is derived from
`SECRET_KEY`, so rotating `SECRET_KEY` makes stored tokens unreadable (it also invalidates every
cookie signature, so users log in again regardless). A session whose tokens cannot be decrypted
is treated as expired and sent back through login rather than trusted. Set a dedicated key to
rotate it independently: list the new key first and keep the old one after it until existing
sessions have expired.

**Session expiry is absolute, not rolling.** A session's lifetime is fixed at login to
`SESSION_COOKIE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` (two weeks by default) and is not extended by activity, so a
continuously active user re-authenticates with the identity provider every two weeks. The
browser cookie's own `Max-Age` is refreshed on each response, but the server-side row is what
decides, and it is not. Lower the value to shorten the window; there is no setting that makes
it rolling.

**Sessions are not swept automatically.** Every login inserts a row and an expired one is simply
refused, so the table grows until an operator prunes it:

```bash
mlflow-oidc db prune-sessions --url postgresql://user:pass@host/auth_db
```

It also deletes expired SAML replay records (`saml_assertions`), which are needed only while their assertion could still validate, and SCIM activity older than `SCIM_ACTIVITY_RETENTION_DAYS`. Add `--dry-run` to see the count without deleting. Revoked-but-unexpired rows are kept until
their expiry, so "was this session revoked, and when?" stays answerable. Running it from cron is
the expected deployment.

**Upgrading:** the session format changed in this release. Cookies issued by an earlier version
no longer authenticate — they carried the username directly, which is exactly what could not be
revoked — so every user logs in again once after the upgrade. No configuration change is needed.

Additional session cookie settings:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` | String | `session` | Session cookie name |
| `SESSION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | String | Derived from `SECRET_KEY` | Key encrypting the provider tokens held on each session row. One or more comma-separated urlsafe-base64 32-byte Fernet keys (generate with `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`); the first encrypts, all decrypt. **All replicas must share it.** Unset: derived from `SECRET_KEY` with HKDF-SHA256. A malformed value stops the server at startup (the error names the setting, never the value) rather than falling back |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` | Integer | `1209600` (2 weeks) | Absolute session lifetime in seconds, fixed at login and not extended by activity. `0` makes the *cookie* last only as long as the browser session; the server-side session still expires after two weeks |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` | String | `lax` | SameSite flag prevents the browser from sending session cookie along with cross-site requests |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | Boolean | `false` | Indicate that the "Secure" flag should be set (can be used with HTTPS only), set this to `true` in production to ensure the session cookie is only sent over HTTPS |
| `SAML_LOGIN_BINDING` | String | `auto` | Binds a SAML login to the browser that started it with a short-lived `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None` nonce cookie scoped to the ACS (login-CSRF defence). `auto`: on iff `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true`; `on`: forced even over http (loopback test rigs only, logged as a warning); `off`: disabled. Any other value refuses to start. See [SAML: browser binding](saml-auth.md#browser-binding) |

## Reverse proxies

`ProxyHeadersMiddleware` applies `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port`,
`X-Forwarded-Prefix` and `X-Forwarded-For` (or `X-Real-IP`) to each request so redirects and
callback URLs are built correctly behind a proxy, so a deployment served under a sub-path (for
example `/mlflow`) routes correctly, and so the SCIM failed-authentication limit and its audit
events name the original client rather than the proxy. The connection address the application
sees (`request.client`) is never replaced. Authorization is always decided on the routed path — the
request path with the forwarded prefix removed — which is the same path the application
dispatches on, and the workspace is resolved on that same path.

These headers are only meaningful when they come from your proxy, so they are honoured only from
the addresses listed in `TRUSTED_PROXIES`. **A deployment behind a reverse proxy must set it** to
the proxy's address or CIDR range:

```bash
TRUSTED_PROXIES=10.0.0.0/8
```

List only proxies: every address inside a listed range can set these headers. IPv4-mapped IPv6
addresses are matched as their IPv4 form, both for the connecting address (`::ffff:10.0.0.5`)
and for entries: `::ffff:10.0.0.5` is read as `10.0.0.5` and `::ffff:10.0.0.0/104` as
`10.0.0.0/8`, and each such conversion is logged at startup. Either notation works.

When `TRUSTED_PROXIES` is unset, no proxy is trusted: the plugin ignores the headers from every
client, and this is logged once at startup at `INFO`. Scheme, host, path and client
address are then the direct connection's, and redirect and callback URLs are built from them
unless `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` is configured. When it is set, the headers from any other client are
ignored; a value in which no entry parses as an address or range trusts no client at all.

For `X-Forwarded-For`, the proxy should append the address it received the request from (the
usual behaviour). The client address is the right-most entry that is not itself inside
`TRUSTED_PROXIES`, reading repeated header lines as one list; when that entry is not an IP
address, the direct connection's address is used. `X-Real-IP` is read only when there is no
`X-Forwarded-For`. Make sure the proxy overwrites, rather than appends to, any other
`X-Forwarded-*` header a client sends.

The trust decision is made on the connection address the ASGI server reports. uvicorn, which
`mlflow server` runs, applies `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` itself for the peers in
its `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` setting (`127.0.0.1` by default) and reports the forwarded address as
the connection address. Keep uvicorn's default: MLflow relies on it to tell same-host requests
from proxied ones. The simplest setup is a proxy on its own, non-loopback address listed in
`TRUSTED_PROXIES`, which uvicorn leaves alone. A proxy on `127.0.0.1` has its requests reported
with the client's address, which the plugin does not trust unless that address is itself inside
`TRUSTED_PROXIES`; for such a deployment set `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` and serve the application at the
same path the proxy exposes rather than relying on `X-Forwarded-Prefix`.

## Upgrading to this release

These behaviour changes ship together in this release. Each is called out here because it
changes what a running deployment does on upgrade; the first one requires a configuration change
for deployments behind a reverse proxy.

- **`TRUSTED_PROXIES` unset now trusts no proxy.** Previously an unset `TRUSTED_PROXIES` honoured
  `X-Forwarded-*` headers from every client. Now they are ignored unless the connecting client is
  inside one of the listed ranges. A deployment behind a reverse proxy that relied on the old
  default must set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to the proxy's address or CIDR range; otherwise a deployment
  mounted under a prefix (`X-Forwarded-Prefix`) no longer routes under that prefix, redirect and
  callback URLs built from the request use the internal scheme and host (unless
  `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` is set), and the SCIM failed-authentication limit and its audit events see
  the proxy's address as the client IP. See [Reverse proxies](#reverse-proxies).
- **The SCIM client IP comes from the trusted proxy.** Behind a proxy listed in
  `TRUSTED_PROXIES`, the SCIM failed-authentication limit and its audit events are now keyed on
  the client address taken from `X-Forwarded-For` (right-most untrusted entry) or `X-Real-IP`,
  rather than on the proxy's address. The connection address (`request.client`) is unchanged.
- **Workspaces are resolved on the routed path.** With `MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES=true`, the
  workspace of a request is resolved on the path the router dispatches — the request path with a
  trusted forwarded prefix removed — the same path authorization decides on.

- **Session tokens move off the cookie.** The refresh token, ID token, and IdP expiry that used
  to live in the signed session cookie now live encrypted on the server-side `auth_sessions` row
  (see [Sessions](#sessions) and `SESSION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` above). A session opened before
  the upgrade carries none of this on its row; its cookie's `expires_at` is honoured as an upper
  bound on the IdP expiry until it passes, at which point the user logs in again as normal and a
  post-upgrade session is issued with tokens stored server-side. No session is forcibly ended by
  the upgrade itself.
- **`exp` is now required on bearer tokens.** Every provider, including the synthesised `default`
  one, now refuses a bearer token with no `exp` claim. If you rely on tokens without an expiry —
  most commonly legacy, non-bound Kubernetes service-account tokens — set
  `allow_tokens_without_expiry: true` on that provider's registry entry before upgrading, or those
  callers start getting `401`. See [Provider registry fields](#provider-registry-fields) and
  [Kubernetes service accounts](kubernetes-auth#tokens-without-an-expiry).
- **Identity claims missing from the ID token are read from the UserInfo endpoint.** A browser
  login whose ID token lacks the username or display name now asks the provider's UserInfo
  endpoint for them, with the login's access token, so providers that release email or name only
  there can sign users in. The ID token's claims still take precedence, and the username an ID
  token already yields does not change. Authorization is unchanged for existing deployments: the
  groups and workspace claims still come from the ID token alone unless you set the new
  `OIDC_USERINFO_GROUPS` (registry: `userinfo_groups`). A login whose UserInfo response carries a
  different or no `sub` is refused, including one that previously succeeded without UserInfo
  (for example, with only the display name missing). Deployments whose ID tokens carry the
  username and display name make no extra request. See
  [Claims and the UserInfo endpoint](#claims-and-the-userinfo-endpoint).
- **Public clients (`OIDC_PUBLIC_CLIENT`, `public_client`).** An OIDC client can now be
  registered without a client secret, as a public client authenticated by PKCE, when it is
  declared so explicitly. Nothing changes for an existing deployment: a client with a secret
  registers exactly as before, and a client without one is still not registered — the error
  logged for it now says to set the secret or declare the client public. See
  [Public clients](#public-clients).
- **Outbound HTTPS trusts the operating system's certificate store.** A private or
  TLS-inspection (DLP/DPI) root CA installed system-wide is now trusted by every call to an
  identity provider, without extra configuration:
  - OIDC discovery, token and userinfo requests (via `httpx2`) verify against the operating
    system's store.
  - Bearer-token discovery and JWKS fetches, SAML metadata, and the bundled Entra group plugin
    verify against the operating system's store *in addition to* certifi's bundled list, or to
    `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` when it is set, as before.
  - The Kubernetes provider's cluster CA is still trusted on its own, never combined with either.
  If your private root is only in `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, also install it system-wide (or set
  `SSL_CERT_FILE`) so the login flow trusts it too.
- **Bearer tokens are verified with `joserfc`.** Token validation moved from the deprecated
  `authlib.jose` module to `joserfc`, which is now a direct dependency. Accepted algorithms, the
  `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf` and `iat` checks, `kid` selection and the key refresh on a failed
  signature are unchanged. A few malformed tokens that were accepted before are now refused: one
  signed with a key whose JWKS entry names a different `alg` than the token's header, one whose
  registered header parameters have the wrong type or form (a non-string `kid` or `typ`, a
  `jku` that is not an http(s) URL, a non-boolean `b64`), and one whose signature segment
  carries base64 padding. Standards-conforming identity providers issue none of these.
- **Artifact paths that name no experiment are denied.** The artifact proxy used to authorize a
  path it could not map to an experiment with `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION`. That setting ships as
  `MANAGE`, so on a default deployment any authenticated user could download, upload to or
  delete the artifact root (`DELETE /api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/artifacts/.` emptied every
  experiment's artifacts) and list every experiment id. Such paths now get `403` for every
  method. Listing the root still works, but it returns only the experiments the caller can read.
  This is a behaviour change only if you run `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=MANAGE` (or any level
  above `NO_PERMISSIONS`). MLflow's own client and UI are unaffected when experiment artifact
  locations sit directly under the proxy root (`mlflow-artifacts:/<experiment_id>` or
  `mlflow-artifacts:/workspaces/<ws>/<experiment_id>`, MLflow's default layout). **If your
  artifact root or a workspace's `default_artifact_root` adds a prefix** (for example
  `--default-artifact-root mlflow-artifacts:/mlartifacts`, giving
  `mlflow-artifacts:/mlartifacts/<experiment_id>`), the plugin cannot tell which experiment such a
  path belongs to, and non-admin artifact uploads, downloads and listings through the proxy are
  now denied. Before, they were allowed for everyone, including other tenants. Keep experiment
  locations at the top of the proxy root to use the proxy as a non-admin. A tool that wrote to or
  deleted the artifact root as a non-admin must now run as an administrator. On a `NO_PERMISSIONS` deployment these requests
  were already denied, and nothing changes except that the root listing is now filtered rather
  than refused. The logged-model artifact routes and the run presigned-URL routes are also
  authorized now; before, they had no check. See [Artifact Access](permissions#artifact-access).

  **Artifacts-only servers** (`mlflow server --artifacts-only`, or any artifact proxy whose
  tracking store has no experiment table or cannot be reached) are affected too. An artifact
  path is now authorized only after the plugin confirms, in the tracking store, that the
  experiment it names exists. A server that cannot answer that denies all non-admin proxy
  traffic, and logs the store error. Keep the tracking store reachable from the artifact
  server, or route non-admin artifact traffic through the tracking server.

- **Some requests also need a grant on the resource they reference.** Creating a model version
  needs READ on the run, logged model, experiment or registered model its `source`, `run_id`
  and `model_id` point at; logging a metric to a logged model (`LogMetric` / `LogBatch` with
  `model_id`) and minting a presigned upload URL for a logged model need EDIT on that logged
  model's experiment; creating or updating a gateway model definition needs USE on its secret;
  creating or updating a gateway endpoint, or attaching a model to one, needs USE on every model
  definition it routes to, and EDIT on the experiment named in `experiment_id`. Admins are
  unaffected. With the default `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=MANAGE` most users already hold these
  grants; on a deny-by-default deployment, grant them before upgrading. See
  [Resources a request references](permissions#resources-a-request-references).
- **Model version sources are checked.** A model version whose `source` is a storage location
  (`s3://`, `gs://`, a local path, a URL other than the artifact proxy) must lie under the
  artifact root of the `run_id` or `model_id` the request names; with neither id, creating it
  is admin-only. A prompt version's source must be MLflow's placeholder (`dummy-source` or
  `prompt-template`, which MLflow's own clients send) unless it follows the same rules. A client
  that registers models from arbitrary storage locations, or creates prompt versions with
  another placeholder, must run as an administrator or send the source through a run or
  logged model. See [Creating a model version](permissions#creating-a-model-version).
- **Routes without a validator are refused to non-admins.** A request to an MLflow route that
  has no authorization rule now gets `403` for a non-admin user instead of being served. Admins
  are unaffected. See [Routes without a validator](permissions#routes-without-a-validator).
- **GenAI routes now need experiment grants.** Evaluation datasets, issues, label schemas,
  review queues, UI jobs, scorer online-scoring configuration, `issues/invoke` and
  `genai/evaluate/invoke` now check the permission of the
  experiment they belong to. A non-admin needs the grant listed in
  [Experiment-scoped GenAI routes](permissions#experiment-scoped-genai-routes); with the
  default `DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=MANAGE` most users already hold it. Requests that name no
  experiment (an unscoped dataset or issue search, a dataset linked to no experiment, a job with
  no recorded experiment) are admin-only. Gateway budget reads (`gateway/budgets/get`, `list`,
  `windows`) and demo-data generation are admin-only.
- **Job API jobs belong to their creator.** On MLflow's FastAPI job API
  (`/ajax-api/3.0/jobs/…`), fetching or cancelling a job by id now requires being the user who
  submitted it, and `jobs/search` returns only the caller's own jobs. Previously any
  authenticated user could do both for every job. Jobs with no recorded creator (submitted
  before MLflow recorded one, or on an MLflow release that does not) are visible to admins only.
  Submitting a job (`POST /ajax-api/3.0/jobs/`) now requires the permissions its parameters
  call for: EDIT on every experiment the job acts on, directly or through a run or trace. A job
  function the plugin does not classify is admin-only. Previously any authenticated user could
  submit any allowed job with any parameters. MLflow's own UI starts these jobs through
  experiment-scoped routes, which are unchanged.
  Admins are unaffected. See [Job API](permissions#job-api).
- **Creating a prompt optimization job checks the prompt and dataset.**
  `POST 3.0/mlflow/prompt-optimization/jobs` now needs EDIT on the source prompt, which the job
  registers a new version of, and READ on the experiments of the training dataset, in addition
  to EDIT on the experiment. A `source_prompt_uri` that is not a `prompts:/` URI, or a dataset
  that cannot be resolved, is refused. Admins are unaffected.
- **`ListScorers` is filtered per scorer.** Listing scorers without an `experiment_id`, which
  MLflow answers with the scorers of every active experiment, is now allowed for any
  authenticated user instead of being refused, and both forms of the request omit scorers the
  caller cannot read: a scorer needs READ on its experiment, and a `NO_PERMISSIONS` grant on the
  scorer itself hides it. Admins are unaffected.
- **Review queues and label schemas follow MLflow's own authorization rules.** Creating,
  updating or deleting a label schema needs MANAGE on the experiment (before: EDIT to create or
  update). Opening a review queue (`get`, `get-by-name`, `items/list`) needs, besides READ,
  MANAGE, being assigned to the queue, or EDIT and owning it. Updating a queue needs MANAGE, or
  EDIT and ownership (before: any EDIT user). Removing items needs MANAGE, or EDIT and ownership
  of a custom queue (before: any EDIT user). Submitting a review (`items/set-status`) needs EDIT
  and being assigned to the queue, for every non-admin including one with MANAGE. The queue
  list shows a READ-only user only the queues they are assigned to. A custom queue can no longer
  be created with, or renamed to, a registered username, by anyone including an administrator.
  One operation becomes available: the EDIT owner of a custom queue may now delete it (before:
  MANAGE only). See [Experiment-scoped GenAI routes](permissions#experiment-scoped-genai-routes).
- **The `[saml]` extra is optional.** SAML support (see [SAML Authentication](saml-auth)) ships
  behind `pip install "mlflow-oidc-auth[saml]"`. A deployment that does not install it or
  configure a `saml` provider is unaffected — nothing here changes its behaviour.
- **Trash cleanup no longer hard-deletes a run whose artifacts could not be removed.**
  `POST /oidc/trash/cleanup` used to log a warning and hard-delete the run's metadata anyway when
  artifact deletion failed, orphaning the artifacts. It also could not resolve a run whose
  artifact URI used the proxied `mlflow-artifacts:` scheme, which always failed on a server (the
  process-global tracking URI there is the backend-store URI, not an HTTP endpoint) — that failure
  is now fixed by resolving such URIs against `--artifacts-destination`, the same way MLflow's own
  server does. When artifact deletion still fails for some other reason, the run's metadata is now
  kept and the failure is reported in the response's `failed_runs` list instead of being silently
  discarded. Before hard-deleting an experiment, cleanup now always confirms it owns no run at
  all (for any reason a run was kept, not only a failed artifact deletion — hard-deleting the
  experiment would otherwise cascade-delete that run's metadata through MLflow's own
  experiment/run relationship); an experiment that still owns a run is kept too and reported in
  `failed_experiments` instead. A deployment that automates cleanup and only checks the HTTP
  status code should also check those lists; runs and experiments that fail to clean up stay in
  the trash instead of disappearing with orphaned artifacts.
- **Cleanup with only `run_ids` no longer sweeps every other trashed experiment.** Calling
  `POST /oidc/trash/cleanup?run_ids=...` without `experiment_ids` used to also hard-delete every
  experiment in the deleted lifecycle stage (and, through it, every run of those experiments too)
  as a side effect, regardless of `older_than`. It now touches only the named runs. Calls that
  name `experiment_ids` (with or without `run_ids`), or name neither (the "empty trash" case),
  are unaffected. See [Trash Management](api-reference#trash-management).
- **Trash cleanup failure reasons are fixed strings.** The `error` of each `failed_runs` /
  `failed_experiments` entry is now one of `Failed to delete artifacts`, `Failed to delete run`,
  `Run not found`, `Could not verify no runs remain`, `Failed to delete experiment`, or one of the
  existing lifecycle/age reasons, instead of the underlying exception text. The exception is still
  written to the server log. Automation that matched on exception text should match on these
  reasons instead.
- **Redis cache URL and some MLflow settings are no longer logged.** The cache factory no longer
  writes `CACHE_REDIS_URL` (which can carry a password) to the log, and
  `configure_mlflow_environment()` / `mlflow-oidc-server` now log only the name of each MLflow
  variable it sets, not its value. `mlflow-oidc-server --show-config` and `--dry-run` still print
  values, but mask the password of any `scheme://user:password@` URI in them.

## MLflow Server Environment Variables

MLflow natively supports environment variables for server configuration. These are not managed by the plugin but are commonly used alongside it:

| CLI Parameter | Environment Variable | Description |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `--backend-store-uri` | `MLFLOW_BACKEND_STORE_URI` | Database URI for experiments, runs, models |
| `--registry-store-uri` | `MLFLOW_REGISTRY_STORE_URI` | Model registry URI (defaults to backend store) |
| `--default-artifact-root` | `MLFLOW_DEFAULT_ARTIFACT_ROOT` | Default artifact storage location |
| `--artifacts-destination` | `MLFLOW_ARTIFACTS_DESTINATION` | Proxied artifact storage destination |
| `--serve-artifacts` | `MLFLOW_SERVE_ARTIFACTS` | Enable artifact proxying |
| `--workers` | `MLFLOW_WORKERS` | Number of uvicorn workers |
| `--uvicorn-opts` | `MLFLOW_UVICORN_OPTS` | Additional uvicorn server options |
| `--gunicorn-opts` | `MLFLOW_GUNICORN_OPTS` | Additional gunicorn server options |

## Configuration Examples

### Minimal Development Setup

```bash
# .env file
OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL=https://your-idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=mlflow-dev
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=dev-secret
SECRET_KEY=dev-not-for-production
```

or, for a public client that has no client secret — declared with `OIDC_PUBLIC_CLIENT`, and
authenticated by PKCE, which is on by default (see [Public clients](#public-clients)):

```bash
# .env file
OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL=https://your-idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=mlflow-dev-public
OIDC_PUBLIC_CLIENT=true
SECRET_KEY=dev-not-for-production
```

### Security-First Production Setup

```bash
# Deny all access by default — require explicit permission grants
DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=NO_PERMISSIONS

# Strict group requirements
OIDC_GROUP_NAME=mlflow-users,mlflow-data-scientists
OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP_NAME=mlflow-admins

# PostgreSQL backends
MLFLOW_BACKEND_STORE_URI=postgresql://mlflow:pass@db:5432/mlflow
OIDC_USERS_DB_URI=postgresql://mlflow:pass@db:5432/mlflow_auth

# Explicit secret key for multi-replica deployments
SECRET_KEY=your-random-64-char-hex-string

# Secure session cookies
SESSION_COOKIE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS=0
SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=strict
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true

# Disable API docs
ENABLE_API_DOCS=false

# Auto-redirect to OIDC login
AUTOMATIC_LOGIN_REDIRECT=true
```

### Multi-Tenant Workspace Setup

```bash
# Enable workspaces
MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES=true

# New users get no workspace access by default
OIDC_WORKSPACE_DEFAULT_PERMISSION=NO_PERMISSIONS

# Detect workspace from OIDC token claim
OIDC_WORKSPACE_CLAIM_NAME=organization

# Cache workspace permissions (5 min TTL, 2048 max entries)
WORKSPACE_CACHE_MAX_SIZE=2048
WORKSPACE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=300

# Deny access to resources without explicit permissions
DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=NO_PERMISSIONS
```

### Group-Priority Permission Resolution

```bash
# Check group permissions before individual user permissions
PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER=group,user,group-regex,regex

# Read-only by default
DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION=READ
```

### Multi-Replica with Redis Cache

```bash
# Shared cache backend for permission invalidation across replicas
CACHE_BACKEND=redis
CACHE_REDIS_URL=redis://redis-host:6379/0

# Short permission cache TTL for faster propagation
PERMISSION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=30

# JWKS cache (always local, 5 min default is fine)
OIDC_JWKS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=300

# JWT audience validation (recommended for production)
OIDC_AUDIENCE=my-mlflow-client-id

# Trusted proxy CIDR (if behind a load balancer)
TRUSTED_PROXIES=10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12

# All replicas must share the same secret key
SECRET_KEY=your-random-64-char-hex-string
```
